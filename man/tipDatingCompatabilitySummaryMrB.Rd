\title{Get the Compatibility Summary Topology From a Tip-Dating Analysis with MrBayes}
\usage{
tipDatingCompatabilitySummaryMrB(runFile, nRuns = 2, burnin = 0.5,
  compatibilityThreshold = 0.5, labelPostProb = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{runFile}{A filename in the current directory, or a path to a file that is either a .p 
or .t file from a MrBayes analysis. This filename and path will be used for finding additional 
.t and .p files, via the \code{nRuns} settings and assuming that files are in the
same directory \emph{and} these files are named under
typical MrBayes file naming conventions. (In other words, if you have renamed your .p or .t files,
this function probably won't be able to find them.)}

\item{nRuns}{The number of runs in your analysis. This variable is used for figuring out what 
filenames will be searched for: if you specify that you have less runs than you
actually ran in reality, then some runs won't be examined in thi function. Conversely,
specify too many, and this function will throw an error when it cannot find files it expects
but do not exist. The default for this argument (\emph{two} runs) is based on the default number of runs in MrBayes.}

\item{burnin}{The fraction of trees sampled in the posterior discarded  and not returned
by this function directly, nor included in calculation of summary trees. Must be a numeric
value greater than 0 and less than 1.}

\item{compatibilityThreshold}{The posterior probability threshold (between 1 and zero, post-burn-in)
that a node must satisfy to appear on the output summary tree. The default is 0.5, making the
trees output half-compatibility trees (summary topologies), similar to the majority-rule
consensus commonly used in maximum parsimony analyses.  The value cannot be lower than 0.5 due to
current technical constraints, and the need for an R function that iteratively ranks possible splits to
be included in a consensus, as the consensus is calculated. Currently, if a clade frequency threshold
given (argument \code{p}) to  \code{ape} function \code{\link[ape]{consensus}}, which is used
internally by \code{halfCompatTree}, all nodes above that compatibility threshold, even splits
which are contradictory, will be included on the output tree, often resulting in uninterpretable output.}

\item{labelPostProb}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then nodes of the
output tree will be labeled with their respective posterior 
probabilities, as calculated based on the frequency of a clade
occurring across the post-burnin posterior tree sample. If \code{FALSE},
this is skipped.}
}
\value{
A single, undated summary tree, containing those clades (splits) found in greater frequency in
the post-burnin posterior tree sample more than the value of \code{compatibilityThreshold}, of
class \code{phylo}. If \code{labelPostProb = TRUE}, nodes will be labeled with the posterior probability of
the respective clade.
}
\description{
This function is designed to avoid methodological
issues with getting sensible consensus summary topologies from posteriors samples of
tip-dated, sampled-ancestor trees output by Mr Bayes. This function will obtain samples of posterior trees,
from external files, remove the specified burn-in,
and output an undated summary tree of clades (splits) indicated on the output tree, as a particular posterior 
probability threshold. Posterior probabilities may be appended to the nodes of the output phylogeny.
This function should be used for examining topological variation in the posterior.
}
\details{
This function is most useful for dealing with dating analyses in MrBayes, particularly when tip-dating
a tree with fossil taxa, as the half-compatibility and all-compatibility summary trees offered by the
'\code{sumt}' command in MrBayes can have issues properly portraying summary trees from such datasets.

Summary topologies calculated with some tip-dating software environments, such as MrBayes,
can be subject to strange and uninterpretable methodological artifacts
as the methods use attempt to present summary topologies with
branch lengths. Many of these algorithms as currently implemented
cannot handle the two-degree nodes or zero-length branches
that arise from having sampled ancestors. Users looking to summarize a tip-dating analysis cannot
easily calculate a dated summary: if they want a dated tree, they \emph{must} examine a
single tree from the posterior (either randomly selected or chosen based on some criteria
such as marginal likelihood, posterior probability, etc). However, if our main interest is
the unscaled evolutionary closeness of taxonomic units without reference to time,
then it is sufficient to examine a summary of the topological variation over our posterior.
}
\note{
Consensus trees that combine clades found different trees in the same tree sample
may inadvertently combine clades that are not found on any of the actual trees
sampled in the posterior, and may be quite far from the posterior trees
as sampled in multivariate tree-space. This is a standard criticism leveled at consensus-type summary trees,
except for the strict consensus (equivalent here to if a user tried \code{compatibilityThreshold = 1}). However,
post-burnin posterior tree samples often sample (and thus contain) a considerable range of
tree-space within them, and thus the strict consensus (a total compatibility tree?)

\examples{
\dontrun{
#pull post-burnin trees from the posterior
      # and get the half-compatibility summary (majority-rule consensus)
      # by setting 'compatibilityThreshold = 0.5'

halfCompatTree <- tipDatingCompatabilitySummaryMrB(
 	runFile = "C:\\\\myTipDatingAnalysis\\\\MrB_run_fossil_05-10-17.nex.run1.t",
 	nRuns = 2, burnin = 0.5, 
 	compatibilityThreshold = 0.5,
 	labelPostProb = TRUE
 	)

# let's try plotting it with posterior probabilities as node labels
plot(halfCompatTree)
nodelabels(halfCompatTree$node.label)
 
}

ways of processing and evaluating trees from MrBayes posterior samples.

Summary trees are estimated using the function \code{\link[ape]{consensus}}
in package \code{ape}.
