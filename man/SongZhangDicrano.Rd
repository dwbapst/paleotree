\title{Cladistic Data for Dicranograptid Graptolites from Song and Zhang (2014)}
\format{Loading this dataset adds two objects to the R environment.
\code{charMatDicrano} is a \code{data.frame} object composed of multiple factors, with \code{NA} values
representing missing values (states coded as '?'), read in with \code{readNexus} from package
\code{phylobase}. \code{cladogramDicranoX12} and 
\code{cladogramDicranoX13} are both cladograms, formatted as \code{phylo} class objects
for use with package \code{ape}, without branch-lengths (as
these was are, respectively, consensus tree and a maximum-parsimony tree from seperate
maximum-parsimony analyses).}

\description{
Character matrix and two cladograms for 13 dicranograptid
(and outgroup) graptoloids, taken from Song and Zhang (2014). Included
here for use with functions related to character change.
}
\details{
This example dataset is composed of a small cladistic character data for 13 taxa and 24 characters,
taken from Song and Zhang (2014). Note that character 22 is a biostratigraphic character, which was
not included in all analyses by Song and Zhang.

The first included cladogram \code{cladogramDicranoX12} is the
majority-rule consensus of a maximum-parsimony analysis on 12
taxa (excluding on taxa with incompletely known anatomy) with
24 characters, including a biostratigraphic character. This
tree is included here as, among the four trees depicted,
it appeared to be the basis for the majority of Song and
Zhang's discussion of dicranograptid systematics.

The second cladogram \code{cladogramDicranoX13} is a maximum-parsimony tree found by a maximum-parsimony
analysis of 13 taxa with 24 characters, including a biostratigraphic character. This tree is much more resolved
than the alternative majority-rule cladogram for 12 taxa.

The matrix and both trees were entered by hand from their flat graphic depiction in Song and Zhang's
manuscript.
