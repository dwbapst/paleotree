#' Get the Sample of Posterior Trees from a Dated Phylogenetic Analysis with MrBayes (Or a Summary Tree, such as the MCCT)
#' 
#' MrBayes is not great for getting samples of dated posterior phylogenies, or for obtaining certain summary trees from
#' the posterior (specifically the MCCT and MAP, which are specific trees in the posterior). This is because the tree
#' samples as returned are scaled relative to rate parameters in a separate file. This function attempts to automate
#' the handling of multiple files (both .t tree files and .p parameter files), as well as multiple files
#' associated with separate runs, to obtain samples of posterior trees, or summary trees such as the MCCT or MAP.
#' These resulting trees are now scaled to units of time, but not be placed correctly on an absolute time-scale
#' if all tips are extinct. See details of output below.

#' @details
#' This function is most useful for dealing with dating analyses in MrBayes, particularly when tip-dating
#' a tree with fossil taxa, as the half-compatibility and all-compatibility summary trees offered by the
#' 'sumt' command in MrBayes can have issues properly portraying summary trees from such datasets.

#' @param runFile A filename in the current directory, or a path to a file that is either a .p 
#' or .t file from a MrBayes analysis. This filename and path will be used for finding additional 
#' .t and .p files, via the \code{nRuns} settings and assuming that files are in the
#' same directory \emph{and} these files are named under
#' typical MrBayes file naming conventions. (In other words, if you have renamed your .p or .t files,
#' this function probably won't be able to find them.)

#' @param nRuns The number of runs in your analysis. This variable is used for figuring out what 
#' filenames will be searched for: if you specify that you have less runs than you
#' actually ran in reality, then some runs won't be examined in thi function. Conversely,
#' specify too many, and this function will throw an error when it cannot find files it expects
#' but do not exist. The default for this argument (\emph{two} runs) is based on the default number of runs in MrBayes.

#' @param burnin The fraction of trees sampled in the posterior discarded  and not returned
#' by this function directly, nor included in calculation of summary trees. Must be a numeric
#' value greater than 0 and less than 1.

#' @param getFixedTimes If \code{TRUE}, this function will also look for, scan, and parse an
#' associated NEXUS file. Ignoring any commented lines (ie. anything between "[   ]" ), commands
#' for fixing taxa will be identified, parsed and returned to the user, either as a message
#' printed to the R console if output is read to a file, or as a attribute named 'fixed ages'
#' if output as an R object (formatted as a two-column table of OTU names and their respective fixed ages).
#' If the output is an R object, these objects with 
#' 
#' Please note: the code for \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE} contains a \code{while()}
#' loop in it for removing nested series of
#' square brackets (i.e. treated as comments in NEXUS files). Thus files with
#' ridiculously nested series of brackets may cause this code to take a while
#' to complete, or may even cause it to hang.

#' @param getRootAges \code{FALSE} by default. 
#' If \code{TRUE}, and \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE} as well as \code{file = NULL}
#' (such that trees will be assigned within the R memory rather than saved to an external file), the
#' functions \code{setRootAge} and its wrapper function \code{setRootAges} will be applied to the output
#' so that all output trees have \code{root.time} elements for use with other functions in \code{paleotree}
#' as well as other packages.

#' @param originalNexusFile Filename (and possibly path too) to the original NEXUS file for this analysis.
#' Only tried if \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE}. If \code{NULL} (the default), then this function will
#' instead try to find a NEXUS file with the same name as implied by the filename used in other inputs. If
#' this file cannot be found, the function will fail. 

#' @param labelPostProb Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then nodes of the
#' output tree will be labeled with their respective posterior 
#' probabilities, as calculated based on the frequency of a clade
#' occurring across the post-burnin posterior tree sample. If \code{FALSE},
#' this is skipped.
	
#' @param outputTrees Determines the output trees produced; for format of output, see section
#' on returned Value below. Must be of length one, and either \code{"all"},
#' which means all trees from the post-burnin posterior will
#' returned, a number greater than zero, which will be the number of trees
#' randomly sampled from across the post-burning posterior and returned,
#' or \code{"MCCT"} and \code{"MAP"}, which stand for 'maximum clade compatibility tree'
#' and 'maximum a posteri tree' respectively. The MAP is the single tree from the post-burnin
#' posterior with the highest marginal likelihood. The MCCT is the single tree from the post-burnin
#' posterior which contains clades with the highest product of posterior probabilities for its
#' component clades. Thus, the MAP is the best overall tree, while the MCCT may be the best
#' tree for summarizing topological support.

#' @param file Filename (possibly with path) as a character string
#' leading to a file which will be overwritten with the output trees (or summary tree),
#' as a NEXUS file. If \code{NULL} (the default), the output will
#' instead be directly returned by this function.



#' @return
#' Depending on argument \code{file}, the output tree or trees is either
#' returned directly, or instead written out in NEXUS format via
#' ape's \code{write.NEXUS} function to an external file. The output
#' will consist either of multiple trees sampled from the post-burnin posterior,
#' or will consist of a single phylogeny (a summary tree, either the MCCT or the MAP).
#' 
#' If the argument \code{setRootAges = TRUE} is not used,
#' users are warned that the resulting dated trees will not have \code{$root.time} elements necessary
#' for comparison against an absolute time-scale. Wile the trees may be scaled to units of absolute
#' time now, rather than with branch lengths expressed in the rate of character change, the dates
#' estimated by some phylogenetics functions in R may give inaccurate estimates of when events
#' occur on the absolute time-scale if all tips are extinct.
#' This is because most functions for phylogenetics in R (and
#' elsewhere) will instead presume that the latest tip will be at time 0 (the modern), which
#' may be wrong if you are using \code{paleotree} for analyzing \emph{paleontological} datasets
#' consisting of entirely extinct taxa. This can be solved by using argument \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE}
#' to obtain fixed tip ages, and then scaling the resulting output to absolute time using
#' the argument \code{setRootAges = TRUE}, which obtains a \code{$root.time} element for each tree
#' using the functions \code{\link{setRootAge}} and \code{\link{setRootAges}} (for single and multiple phylogenies).
#'


#' @seealso 
#' When the arguments \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE} and \code{setRootAges = TRUE} are used, the resulting output will be scaled to absolute time 
#' with the available fixed ages using functions \code{\link{setRootAge}} and \code{\link{setRootAges}} (for single and multiple phylogenies).
#' This is only done if fixed ages are available and if the tree is not being saved to an external file.
#' 
#' Maximum Clade Credibility trees are estimated using the function\code{\link[phangorn]{maxCladeCred}} in package phangorn.
#' 
#' See function \code{link{tipDatingCompatabilitySummaryMrB}} for additional
#' ways of solely evaluating the topoligical information in trees taken from MrBayes posterior samples.
