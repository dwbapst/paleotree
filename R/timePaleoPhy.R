#' Typical 'a posteriori' Time-Scaling Approaches For Paleontological Phylogenies
#' 
#' Time-scales an unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa using information on their
#' temporal ranges, using various methods. Also can resolve polytomies randomly
#' and output samples of randomly-resolved trees. As simple methods of time-scaling
#' phylogenies of fossil taxa can have biasing effects on macroevolutionary analyses
#' (Bapst, 2014, Paleobiology), this function is largely retained for legacy purposes
#' and plotting applications. The time-scaling methods implemented
#' by the functions listed here do \bold{not} return realistic estimates of 
#' divergence dates, users should investigate other time-scaling methods such as \code{\link{cal3TimePaleoPhy}}.
#' 
#' @details 
#' \emph{Time-Scaling Methods}
#'
#' These functions are an attempt to unify and collect previously used and
#' discussed 'a posteriori' methods for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa.
#' Unfortunately, it can be difficult to attribute some time-scaling methods to
#' specific references in the literature.
#' 
#' There are five main a posteriori approaches that can be used by \code{timePaleoPhy}. Four of these
#' main types use some value of absolute time, chosen a priori, to time-scale the tree.
#' This is handled by the argument \code{vartime}, which is NULL by default and unused
#' for type "basic".
#' 
#' \describe{

#'  \item{"basic"}{This most simple of time-scaling methods ignores \code{vartime} and
#' scales nodes so they are as old as the first appearance of their oldest
#' descendant (Smith, 1994). This method produces many zero-length branches
#' (Hunt and Carrano, 2010).}

#'  \item{"equal"}{The 'equal' method defined by G. Lloyd and used in Brusatte
#' et al. (2008) and Lloyd et al. (2012). Originally usable in code supplied by
#' G. Lloyd, the algorithm is recreated here as closely as possible. This method
#' works by increasing the time of the root divergence by some amount and then
#' adjusting zero-length branches so that time on early branches is re-apportioned
#' out along those later branches equally. Branches are adjusted in order relative
#' to the number of nodes separating the edge from the root, going from the furthest
#' (most shallow) edges to the deepest edges. The choice of ordering algorithm can have
#' an unanticipated large effect on the resulting time-scaled trees created using "equal"
#' and it appears that paleotree and functions written by G. Lloyd were not always consistent.
#' The default option described here was only introduced into either software sources in
#' August 2014. Thus, two legacy 'equal' methods are included in this function, so users can
#' emulate older ordering algorithms for 'equal' which are now deprecated, as they do not
#' match the underlying logic of the original 'equal' algorithm and do not minimize down-passes
#' when adjusting branch lengths on the time-scaled tree.
#'
#' The root age can be adjusted backwards in time by either increasing by
#' an arbitrary amount (via the \code{vartime}  argument) or by setting the
#' root age directly (via the \code{node.mins} argument); conversely, the
#' function will also allow a user to opt to not alter the root age at all.}

#' \item{"equal_paleotree_legacy"}{Exactly like 'equal' above, except that edges are ordered instead
#' by their depth (i.e. number of nodes from the root). This minor modified version
#' was referred to as 'equal' for this \code{timePaleoPhy} function in \code{paleotree} until February 2014, and thus is
#' included here solely for legacy purposes. This ordering algorithm does not minimize branch adjustment cycles,
#' like the newer default offered under currently 'equal'.}

#' \item{"equal_date.phylo_legacy"}{Exactly like 'equal' above, except that edges are ordered relative
#' to their time (ie. total edge length) from the root following the application of the 'basic'
#' time-scaling method, exactly as in G. Lloyd's original application. This was the method for sorting
#' edges in the "equal" algorithm in G. Lloyd's \code{date.phylo} script and \code{DatePhylo} in
#' package \code{strap} until August 2014, and was the default "equal" algorithm in \code{paleotree}'s \code{timePaleoPhy}
#' function from February 2014 until August 2014.  This ordering algorithm does not minimize branch adjustment cycles,
#' like the newer default offered under currently 'equal'. Due to how the presence of zero-length
#' branches can make ordering branches based on time to be very unpredictable, this version of the 'equal'
#' algorithm is \bold{highly not recommended}.}

#' \item{"aba"}{All branches additive. This method takes the "basic" tree and
#' adds vartime to all branches. Note that this time-scaling method can warp the
#' tree structure, leading to tips to originate out of order with the appearance
#' data used.}

#' \item{"zlba"}{Zero-length branches additive. This method adds vartime to all
#' zero-length branches in the "basic" tree. Discussed (possibly?) by Hunt and Carrano,
#' 2010.Note that this time-scaling method can warp the
#' tree structure, leading to tips to originate out of order with the appearance
#' data used.}

#' \item{"mbl"}{Minimum branch length. Scales all branches so they are
#' greater than or equal to vartime, and subtract time added to later branches
#' from earlier branches in order to maintain the temporal structure of events.
#' A version of this was first introduced by Laurin (2004).} }
#' 
#' These functions cannot time-scale branches relative to reconstructed
#' character changes along branches, as used by Lloyd et al. (2012). Please
#' see \code{DatePhylo} in R package \code{strap} for this functionality.
#' 
#' These functions will intuitively drop taxa from the tree with NA for range
#' or are missing from \code{timeData} or \code{timeList}. Taxa dropped from the tree will be
#' will be listed in a message output to the user. The same is done for taxa in
#' the \code{timeList} object not listed in the tree.
#' 
#' As with many functions in the \code{paleotree} library, absolute time is always
#' decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.
#'
#' As of August 2014, please note that the branch-ordering algorithm used in 'equal' has changed
#' to match the current algorithm used by \code{DatePhylo} in package \code{strap}, and that two legacy
#' versions of 'equal' have been added to this function, respectively representing how \code{timePaleoPhy}
#' and \code{DatePhylo} (and its predecessor \code{date.phylo}) applied the 'equal' time-scaling method.
#' 
#' \emph{Interpretation of Taxon Ages in timePaleoPhy}
#'
#' \code{timePaleoPhy} is \emph{primarily} designed for direct application to datasets where taxon first 
#' and last appearances are precisely known in continuous time, with no stratigraphic
#' uncertainty. This is an uncommon form of data to have from the fossil record, 
#' although not an impossible form (micropaleontologists often have very precise 
#' range charts, for example). Instead, most data has some form of stratigraphic uncertainty. However, for some groups,
#' the more typical 'first' and 'last' dates found in the literature or in databases represent the minimum
#' and maximum absolute ages for the fossil collections that a taxon is known
#' is known from. Presumably, the first and last appearances of that taxon in
#' the fossil record is at unknown dates within these bounds. 
#'
#' As of paleotree version 2.0. the treatment of taxon ages in
#' \code{timePaleoPhy} is handled by the argument \code{dateTreatment}.
#' \emph{By default,} this argument is set to 'firstLast' which means the matrix of ages are treated
#' as precise first and last appearance dates (i.e. FADs and LADs). The earlier FADs will be used
#' to calibrate the node ages, which could produce fairly nonsensical results if these are 'minimum'
#' ages instead and reflect age uncertainty. Alternatively, \code{dateTreatment} can be set to 'minMax'
#' which instead treats taxon age data as minimum and maximum bounds on a single point date. 
#' These point dates, if the minimum and maximum bounds option is selected,
#' are chose under a uniform distribution. Many time-scaled trees should be created to approximate
#' the uncertainty in the dates. Additionally, there is a third option for \code{dateTreatment}:
#' users may also make it so that the 'times of observation'
#' of trees are uncertain, such that the tips of the tree (with terminal ranges added) should
#' be randomly selected from a uniform distribution. Essentially, this third option treats the
#' dates as first and last appearances, but treats the first appearance dates as known and
#' fixed, but the 'last appearance' dates as unknown. In previous versions of paleotree,
#' this third option was enacted with the argument \code{rand.obs}, which has been removed for
#' clarity.
#'
#' \emph{Interpretation of Taxon Ages in bin_timePaleoPhy}
#'
#' As an alternative to using \code{timePaleoPhy}, \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} is a wrapper of 
#' \code{timePaleoPhy} which produces time-scaled trees for datasets which only have 
#' interval data available. For each output tree, taxon first and last appearance 
#' dates are placed within their listed intervals under a uniform distribution. 
#' Thus, a large sample of time-scaled trees will approximate the uncertainty in 
#' the actual timing of the FADs and LADs. In some ways, treating taxonomic age uncertainty
#' may be more logical via \code{bin_timePaleoPhy}, as it is tied to specific interval bounds,
#' and there are more options available for certain types of age uncertainty, such as for cases
#' where specimens come from the same fossil site.
#'
#' The input \code{timeList} object for \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} can have overlapping
#' (i.e. non-sequential) intervals, and intervals of uneven size. Taxa alive in the modern should be listed as last 
#' occurring in a time interval that begins at time 0 and ends at time 0. If taxa 
#' occur only in single collections (i.e. their first and last appearance in the 
#' fossil record is synchronous, the argument point.occur will force all taxa
#' to have instantaneous durations in the fossil record. Otherwise, by default,
#' taxa are assumed to first and last appear in the fossil record at different points
#' in time, with some positive duration. The sites matrix can be used to force
#' only a portion of taxa to have simultaneous first and last appearances.
#' 
#' By setting the argument nonstoch.bin to TRUE for \code{bin_timePaleoPhy}, the dates are NOT
#' stochastically pulled from uniform bins but instead FADs are assigned to the
#' earliest time of whichever interval they were placed in and LADs are placed
#' at the most recent time in their placed interval. This option may be useful
#' for plotting. The sites argument becomes arbitrary if \code{nonstoch.bin = TRUE}.
#' 
#' If \code{timeData} or the elements of \code{timeList} are actually \code{data.frames} (as output
#' by \code{read.csv} or \code{read.table}), these will be coerced to a matrix.
#'
#' \emph{Tutorial}

#' A tutorial for applying the time-scaling functions in paleotree, along with
#' an example using real (graptolite) data, can be found here:
#' http://nemagraptus.blogspot.com/2013/06/a-tutorial-to-cal3-time-scaling-using.html
#' 

#' @aliases timePaleoPhy bin_timePaleoPhy

#' @param tree An unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa, of class \code{phylo}. Tip labels
#' must match the taxon labels in the respective temporal data.

#' @param timeData Two-column matrix of first and last occurrences in absolute
#' continuous time, with row names as the taxon IDs used on the tree. This means the
#' first column is very precise FADs (first appearance dates) and the second 
#' column is very precise LADs (last appearance dates), reflect the precise points
#' in time when taxa first and last appear. If there is stratigraphic uncertainty in
#' when taxa appear in the fossil record, it is preferable to use the 'bin'
#' time-scaling functions; however, see the argument \code{dateTreatment}.

#' @param type Type of time-scaling method used. Can be "basic", "equal", "equal_paleotree_legacy", "equal_date.phylo_legacy"
#' "aba", "zbla" or "mbl". Type = "basic" by default. See details below.

#' @param vartime Time variable; usage depends on the method 'type' argument.
#' Ignored if type = "basic".

#' @param ntrees Number of time-scaled trees to output. If ntrees is greater
#' than one and both randres is false and dateTreatment is neither
#' 'minMax' or 'randObs', the function will fail and
#' a warning is issued, as these arguments would simply produce multiple
#' identical time-scaled trees.

#' @param randres Should polytomies be randomly resolved? By default,
#' \code{timePaleoPhy} does not resolve polytomies, instead outputting a time-scaled
#' tree that is only as resolved as the input tree. If \code{randres = T}, then
#' polytomies will be randomly resolved using \code{\link{multi2di}} from the
#' package ape. If \code{randres = T} and \code{ntrees = 1}, a warning is printed that users
#' should analyze multiple randomly-resolved trees, rather than a single such
#' tree, although a tree is still output.

#' @param timeres Should polytomies be resolved relative to the order of
#' appearance of lineages? By default, \code{timePaleoPhy} does not resolve
#' polytomies, instead outputting a time-scaled tree that is only as resolved
#' as the input tree. If \code{timeres = TRUE}, then polytomies will be resolved with
#' respect to time using the paleotree function \code{\link{timeLadderTree}}.
#' See that functions help page for more information; the result of time-order
#' resolving of polytomies generally does not differ across multiple uses,
#' unlike use of \code{multi2di}.

#' @param add.term If true, adds terminal ranges. By default, this function will
#' not add the ranges of taxa when time-scaling a tree, so that the tips
#' correspond temporally to the first appearance datums of the given taxa. If
#' \code{add.term = T}, then the 'terminal ranges' of the taxa are added to the tips
#' after tree is time-scaled, such that the tips now correspond to the last
#' appearance datums.

#' @param inc.term.adj If true, includes terminal ranges in branch length
#' estimates for the various adjustment of branch lengths under all methods
#' except 'basic' (i.e. a terminal length branch will not be treated as zero
#' length is this argument is \code{TRUE} if the taxon at this tip has a non-zero
#' duration). By default, this argument is \code{FALSE} and this function will not
#' include the ranges of taxa when adjusting branch lengths, so that
#' zero-length branches before first appearance times will be extended. An
#' error is returned if this argument is true but \code{type = "basic"} or
#' \code{add.term = FALSE}, as this argument is inconsistent with those argument
#' options.

#' @param dateTreatment This argument controls the interpretation of \code{timeData}. 
#' The default setting \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"} treats the dates 
#' in \code{timeData} as a column of precise first and last appearances. 
#' A second option is \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"}, which 
#' treats these dates as minimum and maximum bounds on single point dates. Under this option,
#' all taxa in the analysis will be treated as being point dates, such that the first appearance
#' is also the last. These dates will be pulled under a uniform distribution. If \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} is used,
#' \code{add.term} becomes meaningless, and the use of it will return an error message. A third option
#' is \code{dateTreatment = "randObs"}. This assumes that the dates in the matrix are first and last appearance times,
#' but that the desired time of observation is unknown. Thus, this is much like \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"} except
#' the effective time of observation (the taxon's LAD under
#' \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"}) is treated as an uncertain date, and
#' is randomly sampled between the first and last appearance times. The FAD still is treated as a fixed number, used
#' for dating the nodes. In previous versions of paleotree, this
#' was called in \code{timePaleoPhy} using the argument \code{rand.obs}, which has been removed
#' for clarity. This temporal uncertainty in times of observation might be useful if
#' a user is interested in applying phylogeny-based approaches to studying trait evolution, but have
#' per-taxon measurements of traits that come from museum specimens with uncertain temporal placement.
#' With both arguments \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} and
#' \code{dateTreatment = "randObs"}, the sampling of dates from random distributions should
#' compel users to produce many time-scaled trees for any given analytical purpose.
#' Note that \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} returns an error in 'bin' time-scaling functions; please use
#' \code{points.occur} instead.




#DEPRECATED HELP TEXT
# @param rand.obs Should the tips represent observation times uniform
# distributed within taxon ranges? This only impacts the location of tip-dates, 
# i.e. the 'times of observation' for taxa, and does not impact the dates used to 
# determine node ages. Thus, this is an alternative to using only the LADs or only the FADs
# as the per-taxon times of observation. For these functions,rand.obs is TRUE can only impact
# the result when add.term is FALSE (otherwise the time of observation can only be the FADs) 
# and so the function fails and a warning is issued. If rand.obs is TRUE, then it is assumed
# that users wish the tips to represent observations made with some temporal
# uncertainty, such that they might have come from any point within a taxon's
# known range.  This might be the case, for example, if a user is interested in
# applying phylogeny-based approaches to studying trait evolution, but have
# per-taxon measurements of traits that come from museum specimens with
# uncertain temporal placement. When rand.obs is TRUE, the tips are placed randomly
# within taxon ranges, as if uniformly distributed, and thus multiple trees should be 
# created and analyzed.

#' @param node.mins The minimum dates of internal nodes (clades) on a phylogeny can be set
#' using node.mins. This argument takes a vector of the same length as the number of nodes,
#' with dates given in the same order as nodes are ordered in the \code{tree$edge} matrix.
#' Note that in \code{tree$edge}, terminal tips are given the first set of numbers
#' (\code{1:Ntip(tree)}), so the first element of \code{node.mins} is the first internal node
#' (the node numbered \code{Ntip(tree)+1}, which is generally the root for most \code{phylo}
#' objects read by \code{read.tree}). Not all nodes need be given minimum dates; those without
#' minimum dates can be given as NA in \code{node.mins}, but the vector must be the same length
#' as the number of internal nodes in \code{tree}. These are minimum date constraints, such that
#' a node will be forced to be \emph{at least as old as this date}, but the final date may be even
#' older depending on the taxon dates used, the time-scaling method applied, the \code{vartime}
#' used and any other minimum node dates given (e.g. if a clade is given a very old minimum date,
#' this will (of course) over-ride any minimum dates given for clades that that node is nested
#' within). Although \code{vartime} does adjust the node age downwards when the equal method
#' is used, if a user has a specific date they'd like to constrain the root to, they should use
#' \code{node.mins} instead because the result is more predictable.

#' @param noisyDrop If \code{TRUE} (the default), any taxa dropped from tree due to not
#' having a matching entry in the time data will be listed in a system message.

#' @param plot If \code{TRUE}, plots the input and output phylogenies.

#' @param timeList A list composed of two matrices giving interval times and
#' taxon appearance dates. The rownames of the second matrix should be the taxon IDs,
#' identical to the \code{tip.labels} for tree. See details.

#' @param nonstoch.bin If \code{TRUE}, dates are not stochastically pulled from
#' uniform distributions. See below for more details.

#' @param sites Optional two column matrix, composed of site IDs for taxon FADs
#' and LADs. The sites argument allows users to constrain the placement of
#' dates by restricting multiple fossil taxa whose FADs or LADs are from the
#' same very temporally restricted sites (such as fossil-rich Lagerstatten) to
#' always have the same date, across many iterations of time-scaled trees. To
#' do this, simply give a matrix where the "site" of each FAD and LAD for every
#' taxon is listed, as corresponding to the second matrix in timeList. If no
#' sites matrix is given (the default), then it is assumed all fossil come from
#' different "sites" and there is no shared temporal structure among the
#' events.

#' @param point.occur If true, will automatically produce a 'sites' matrix
#' which forces all FADs and LADs to equal each other. This should be used when
#' all taxa are only known from single 'point occurrences', i.e. each is only
#' recovered from a single bed/horizon, such as a Lagerstatten.

#' @return The output of these functions is a time-scaled tree or set of
#' time-scaled trees, of either class \code{phylo} or \code{multiphylo}, depending on the
#' argument ntrees. All trees are output with an element $root.time. This is
#' the time of the root on the tree and is important for comparing patterns
#' across trees. Note that the $root.time element is defined relative to the
#' earliest first appearance date, and thus later tips may seem to occur in
#' the distant future under the 'aba' and 'zbla' time-scaling methods.
#' 
#' Trees created with \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} will output with some additional
#' elements, in particular $ranges.used, a matrix which records the
#' continuous-time ranges generated for time-scaling each tree. (Essentially a
#' pseudo-\code{timeData} matrix.)

#' @note Please account for stratigraphic uncertainty in your analysis.
#' Unless you have exceptionally resolved data, select an appropriate option in
#' \code{dateTreatment} within \code{timePaleoPhy}, use the more sophisticated
#' \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} or code your own wrapper function of \code{timePaleoPhy}
#' that accounts for stratigraphic uncertainty in your dataset.
