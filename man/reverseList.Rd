\title{Reverse List Structure}
\usage{
reverseList(list, simplify = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{list}{A list composed of multiple elements, with each element a vector
or list of equal length}

\item{simplify}{Should the result be simplified,
as with the identical argument in \code{sapply}?}
}
\value{
Returns a list with a reversed structure relative to the input, see
above.
}
\description{
Takes a list and reverses the list structure, such that list composed of
five elements with eight sub-elements is restructured to have eight elements
with five sub-elements each, with the order of elements and sub-elements
being retained despite their reversal in hierarchical position.
}
\details{
The function will fail and return an error if all sub-elements are not
vectors or lists of equal length.

This function can be useful for instances when each element of a list is
by-sample, composed of multiple, different tests on that sample, but where
for further analysis/plotting, it would be beneficial to have a list where
each element represented values from the same test performed across multiple
samples (i.e. plotting a box-plot).

list1 <- list(list(1:3),list(1:3),list(1:3))
reverseList(list1,simplify = FALSE)
reverseList(list1,simplify = TRUE)
