#' Convert Simulated Taxon Data into a Phylogeny
#' 
#' Converts temporal and ancestor-descendant relationships of taxa into a
#' time-scaled phylogeny
#' 
#' @details 
#' As described in the documentation for taxa2cladogram, the relationships
#' among morphotaxa in the fossil record are difficult to describe in terms of
#' traditional phylogenies. One possibility is to arbitrarily choose particular
#' instantaneous points of time in the range of some taxa and describe the
#' time-scaled relationships of the populations present at those dates. This is
#' the tactic used by taxa2phylo.
#' 
#' By default, the dates selected (the \code{obs_time} argument) are the last occurences
#' of the taxon, so a simple use of this function will produce a time-scaled
#' tree which describes the relationships of the populations present at the
#' last occurence of each taxon in the sampled data. Alternatively, obs_time
#' can be supplied with different dates within the taxon ranges.
#' 
#' All data relating to when static morpho-taxa appear or disappear in the
#' record is lost; branching points will be the actual time of speciation,
#' which (under budding) will often be in the middle of the temporal range of a
#' taxon.
#' 
#' Cryptic taxa are not dropped or merged as can be done with taxa2cladogram.
#' The purpose of taxa2phylo is to obtain the 'true' pattern of evolution for
#' the observation times, independent of what we might actually be able to
#' recover, for the purpose of comparing in simulation analyses.
#' 
#' As with many functions in the \code{paleotree} library, absolute time is always
#' decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.

#' @param taxaData A five-column matrix of taxonomic data,
#' as output by \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa} via simulations
#' produced using \code{simFossilRecord}. Previously, this was the
#' default output of the deprecated function \code{simFossilTaxa}.

#' @param obs_time A vector of per-taxon times of observation which must be in
#' the same order of taxa as in the object \code{taxaData}. 
#' If \code{obs_time = NULL}, the LADs (column 4) in \code{taxaData} are used

#' @param plot If \code{TRUE} result the output with \code{ape::plot.phylo}.

#' @return The resulting phylogeny with branch lengths is output as an object
#' of class phylo. This function will output trees with the element $root.time,
#' which is the time of the root divergence in absolute time.
#' 
#' The tip labels are the rownames from the simulation input; see documentation
#' for \code{simFossilRecord} and \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa} documentation for details.

#' @note DO NOT use this function to time-scale a real tree for a real dataset.
#' It assumes you know the divergence/speciation times of the branching nodes
#' and relationships perfectly, which is almost impossible given the
#' undersampled nature of the fossil record. Use timePaleoPhy or
#' cal3TimePaleoPhy instead.
#' 
#' DO use this function when doing simulations and you want to make a tree of
#' the 'true' history, such as for simulating trait evolution along
#' phylogenetic branches.
#' 
#' Unlike \code{taxa2cladogram}, this function does not merge cryptic taxa in output
#' from \code{simFossilRecord} (via \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa})
#' and I do not offer an option to secondarily drop them.
#' The tip labels should provide the necessary information for users to drop
#' such taxa, however. See \link{simFossilRecord}.
