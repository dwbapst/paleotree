\title{Extrapolating Lower-Level Taxon Phylogenies from Higher-Level Taxon Trees}
\usage{
expandTaxonTree(taxonTree, taxaData, collapse = NULL,
  keepBrLen = FALSE, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxonTree}{A phylo object where tips represent higher taxa}

\item{taxaData}{Character vector of higher taxa, with elements names equal
to the lower taxa. See below.}

\item{collapse}{Character vector of non-monophyletic higher taxa to be
collapsed}

\item{keepBrLen}{Logical, decides if branch lengths should be kept or
discarded. FALSE by default. See details below.}

\item{plot}{If true, plots a comparison between input and output trees}
}
\value{
Outputs the modified tree as an object of class phylo, with the
higher-level taxa expanded into polytomies and the lower-level taxa as the
tip labels.
}
\description{
This function takes a tree composed of higher-level taxa and a vector of
lower-level taxa belonging to the set of higher-level taxa included in the
input tree and produces a tree composed of the lower-level taxa, by treating
the higher-level taxa as unresolved monophyletic polytomies. A user can also
mark higher taxa as paraphyletic such that these are secondarily collapsed
and do not form monophyletic clades in the output tree.
}
\details{
The output tree will probably be a rough unresolved view of the
relationships among the taxa, due to the treatment of higher-level taxa as
polytomies. This is similar to the methods used in Webb and Donoghue (2005)
and Friedman (2009). Any analyses should be done by resolving this tree with
\code{\link{multi2di}} in the ape package or via the various time-scaling
functions found in this package (paleotree).

The taxaData vector should have one element per lower-level taxon that is to
be added to the tree. The name of each element in the vector should be the
names of the lower-level taxa, which will be used as new tip labels of the
output lower-taxon tree. There should be no empty elements! expandTaxonTree
won't know what to do with taxa that don't go anywhere.

By default, all higher-level taxa are treated as monophyletic clades if not
otherwise specified. The collapse vector can (and probably should) be used
if there is doubt about the monophyly of any higher-level taxa included in
the input taxon-tree, so that such a group would be treated as a paraphyletic
group in the output tree.

Also by default, the output tree will lack branch lengths and thus will not be
time-scaled. If keepBrLen is true, then the tree's edge lengths are kept and
new taxa are added as zero length branches attaching to a node that
represents the previous higher-taxon. This tree is probably not useful for
most applications, and may even strongly bias some analyses. USE WITH
CAUTION! The 'collapse' vector will cause such edges to be replaced by
zero-length branches rather than fully collapsing them, which could have odd
effects. If 'collapse' is not null and keepBrLen is true, a warning is
issued that the output probably won't make much sense at all.
