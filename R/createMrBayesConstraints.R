#' Transform a Topology into a Set of Constraint Commands for MrBayes
#' 
#' Takes a phylogeny in the form of an object of class \code{phylo} and
#' outputs a set of topological constraints for \emph{MrBayes} as a set of character
#' strings, either printed in the R console or in a named text file, which
#' can be used as commands in the \emph{MrBayes} block of a NEXUS file for use with 
#' (you guessed it!) \emph{MrBayes}.

#' @details
#' \code{partial = TRUE} may be useful if the reason for using
#' \code{createMrBayesConstraints} is to constrain a topology containing
#' some of the taxa in an analysis, while allowing other taxa to freely
#' vary. For example, Slater (2013) constrained an analysis so extant
#' taxon relationships were held constant, using a molecular-based topology, 
#' while allowing fossil taxa to freely vary relative to their morphological
#' character data. 

#' @param tree An object of class \code{phylo}.

#' @param partial If \code{TRUE} (the default), then constraints will
#' be defined as partial constraints with respect to the rest of the taxa
#' in the input \code{tree}. If \code{FALSE}, constraints will be
#' defined as hard clade membership constraints (i.e. no additional
#' taxa will be allowed to belong to the nodes present in the observed tree.
#' Depending on your analysis, \code{partial = TRUE} may require additionally
#' defining an outgroup.

#' @param file Filename (possibly with path) as a character string
#' to a file which will be overwritten with the output constraint lines.
#' If \code{NULL}, constraint lines are printed in the console.

#' @param includeIngroupConstraint When writing the \code{prset} line, 
#' should a group named 'ingroup' be included, which presumes an ingroup
#' constraint was defined by the user for sake or rooting the tree? This is
#' mainly used for use with \code{paleotree} function \code{createMrBayesTIpDatingNexus} for automating
#' the construction of tip-dating analyses, which must constrain the ingroup.

#' @return
#' If argument \code{file} is \code{NULL}, then the constrain commands
#' are output as a series of character strings.
