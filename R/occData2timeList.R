#' Converting Occurrences Data to a \code{timeList} Data Object
#'
#' This function converts occurrence data, given as a list where each element
#' is a different taxon's occurrence table (containing minimum and maximum ages
#' for each occurrence), to the 'timeList' format, consisting of a list composed
#' of a matrix of lower and upper age bounds for intervals, and a second matrix
#' recording the interval in which taxa first and last occur in the given dataset.

#' @details
#' This function should translate taxon-sorted occurrence data, which could be Paleobiology Database
#' datasets sorted by \code{\link{taxonSortPBDBocc}} or any data object where occurrence data
#' (i.e. age bounds for each occurrence) for different taxa is separated into different elements
#' of a named list. 
#'
#' \subsection{The argument intervalType}{

#'
#' The argument \code{intervalType} controls the algorithm used for obtain first and last interval bounds for
#' each taxon, of which there are several to select from:intervalType
#' \describe{

#'  \item{"dateRange"}{The default option. The bounds on the first appearances
#' are the span between the oldest upper and lower bounds
#' of the occurrences, and the bounds on the last appearances are the span between the youngest
#' upper and lower bounds across all occurrences. This is guaranteed to provide the smallest
#' bounds on the first and last appearances, and was originally suggested to the author by J. Marcot.}

#' \item{"occRange"}{This option returns the smallest bounds among (a) the oldest occurrences for the
#' first appearance (i.e. all occurrences with their lowest bound at the oldest lower age bound), and (b) the
#' youngest occurrences for the last appearance (i.e. all occurrences with their uppermost bound
#' at the youngest upper age bound).}

#' \item{"zoneOverlap"}{This option is an attempt to mimic the stratigraphic range algorithm used by PBDB Classic
#' which "finds the oldest base that is older than at least part of all the intervals and the
#' youngest that is younger than at least part of all the intervals" (personal communication, J. Alroy). 
#' This is a somewhat more complex case as we are trying to obtain a \code{timeList} object.
#' So, for calculating the bounds of the first interval a taxon occurs in, the \code{zoneOverlap}
#' algorithm looks for all occurrences that overlap with the age range of the earliest-most occurrence
#' and (1) obtains their earliest boundary ages and returns the latest-most earliest age boundary among
#' these overlapping occurrences and (2) obtains their latest boundary ages and returns the earliest-most
#' latest age boundary among these overlapping occurrences. Similarly, for calculating the bound of the
#' last interval a taxon occurs in, the \code{zoneOverlap} algorithm looks for all occurrences that overlap
#' with the age range of the latest-most occurrence and (1) obtains their earliest boundary ages and returns
#' the latest-most earliest age boundary among these overlapping occurrences and (2) obtains their latest
#' boundary ages and returns the earliest-most latest age boundary among these overlapping occurrences. 
#'
#' On theoretical grounds, one could probably describe the zone-of-overlap algorithm as minimizing
#' taxonomic age ranges by assuming that all overlapping occurrences at the start and end of a taxon's
#' range probably describe a very similar first and last appearance (FADs and LADs), and thus picks the
#' occurrence with bounds that extends the taxonomic range the least. However, this does come with a downside
#' that if these occurrences are not essentially repeated attempts to capture the same FAD or LAD, then the
#' zone-of-overlap algorithm is not an accurate depiction of the uncertainty in the ages. The true biological
#' range of a taxon might be well outside the bounds obtained using the zone-of-overlap algorithm. A more
#' conservative approach is the \code{"dateRange"} algorithm which finds the smallest possible bounds on the
#' endpoints of a taxon's range without ignoring uncertainty from any particular set of occurrences.} }
#'
#' }
#' 

#' @param occList A list where every element is a table of occurrence data for a different taxon,
#' such as that returned by \code{\link{taxonSortPBDBocc}}. The occurrence data can be either a 
#' two-column matrix composed of the lower and upper age bounds on each taxon occurrence, or has
#' two named variables which match any of the field names given by the PBDB API under either
#' the 'pbdb' vocab or 'com' (compact) vocab for early and late age bounds.

#' @param intervalType Must be either "dateRange" (the default), "occRange" or
#' "zoneOverlap". Please see details below.

#' @return
#' Returns a standard timeList data object, as used by many other paleotree functions, like
#' \code{\link{bin_timePaleoPhy}}, \code{\link{bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy}} and \code{\link{taxicDivDisc}}

#' @seealso
#' \code{\link{taxonSortPBDBocc}}, \code{\link{plotOccData}} and the
#' example graptolite dataset at \code{\link{graptPBDB}}
