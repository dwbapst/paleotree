\usage{
sProb2sRate(R, int.length = 1)

sRate2sProb(r, int.length = 1)

pqsRate2sProb(r, p, q, int.length = 1)

qsProb2Comp(R, q, p = NULL, mode = "budding", nrep = 10000)

qsRate2Comp(r, q)
}
\arguments{
\item{R}{Per-interval probability of sampling a taxon at least once}

\item{int.length}{Length of Time Intervals}

\item{r}{Instantaneous rate of sampling}

\item{p}{Instantaneous rate of speciation (lambda). If the underlying model assumed is
anagenetic (e.g. taxonomic change within a single lineage, 'phyletic evolution') 
with no branching of lineages, then p will be used as the rate of anagenetic differentiation.}

\item{q}{Instantaneous rate of extinction (mu)}

\item{mode}{Mode of morphotaxon differentiation, based on definitions in Foote, 1996. Can be
pure cladogenetic budding ("budding"), pure cladogenetic bifurcating ("bifurcating") or
pure anagenetic within-lineage change ("anagenesis"; i.e. Foote's 'phyletic change'). Default
mode is "budding".}

\item{nrep}{Number of repetitions to run in functions which are meant to sum over infinity.
Default is arbitrarily high.}

\value{
The converted sampling estimate, depending on the function used. See

\description{
Various functions for converting between estimates of sampling in the fossil
record.
}
\details{
This is a family of functions which all convert from some estimate of
sampling to another estimate of sampling. Some of these also require
estimates of an rate associated with taxonomic diversification, such as the
speciation/origination rate or extinction rate. Diversification rates used
in these functions should always be the instantaneous rates, often called
the per-capita rates by paleontologists (Foote, 2000).

As with many models used in the paleotree library, it is generally assumed
that the fossil record of interest is composed of discrete relatively-static
taxonomic units which diversify mainly by budding cladogenesis, and that
sampling events are rare and approximated by a Poisson model of
exponentially-distributed waiting times between sampling events. The
veracity of those assumptions is difficult to test and the sensitivity of
these analyses to relaxing those assumptions probably varies.

sProb2sRate and sRate2sProb give rough conversions for the probability of
sampling once per time interval (R or "sProb" in this package as used in the
references below) and the instantaneous rate of sampling per lineage/time
unit ("sRate" or r). If you have estimates of the speciation and extinction
rate, use pqsRate2sProb instead for a more accurate estimate of R.

qsProb2Comp and qsRate2Comp are different calculations for "Pp" or the
probability/proportion of taxa sampled in a clade. Theoretically, one could
use it to extrapolate out the 'true' diversity, assuming the sampling rate
model was correct. (See Foote and Raup, 1996.)

See the references below for a more detailed explanation of the methods and
formulae used. The relevant equations are generally found in the appendices
of those papers.
