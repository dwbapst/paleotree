#' Simulate Cladogenetic Trait Evolution
#' 
#' This function simulates trait evolution at each speciation/branching event
#' in a matrix output from \code{simFossilRecord}, after transformation with
#' \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa}.
#' 
#' @details This function simulates continuous trait evolution where change occurs under
#' a Brownian model, but only at events that create new distinct morphotaxa
#' (i.e. species as recognized in the fossil record), either branching events
#' or anagenesis (pseudospeciation). These are the types of morphological
#' differentiation which can be simulated in the function \code{simFossilRecord}. This
#' is sometimes referred to as cladogenetic or speciation trait evolution and
#' is related to Punctuated Equilibrium theory. Anagenetic shifts are not
#' cladogenetic events per se (no branching!), so perhaps the best way to this
#' of this function is it allows traits to change anytime \code{simFossilRecord} created
#' a new 'morphotaxon' in a simulation.
#' 
#' Importantly, trait changes only occur at the base of 'new' species, thus
#' allowing cladogenetic trait evolution to be asymmetrical at branching
#' points: i.e. only one branch actually changes position in trait-space, as
#' expected under a budding cladogenesis model. This distinction is important
#' as converting the taxa matrix to a phylogeny and simulating the trait
#' changes under a 'speciational' tree-transformation would assume that
#' divergence occurred on both daughter lineages at each node. (This has been
#' the standard approach for simulating cladogenetic trait change on trees).
#' 
#' Cryptic taxa generated with \code{prop.cryptic} in \code{simFossilRecord} will not differ at
#' all in trait values. These species will all be identical.

#' 
#' @param taxa A five-column matrix of taxonomic data, as output by
#' \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa} after simulation with \code{simFossilRecord}
#' (or via the deprecated function \code{simFossilTaxa})

#' @param rate rate of trait change; variance of evolutionary change
#' distribution per speciation event

#' @param meanChange Mean change per speciation event. Default is 0; change to
#' simulate 'active' speciational trends, where the expected change at each
#' speciational event is non-zero.

#' @param rootTrait The trait value of the first taxon in the dataset; set to 0
#' by default.

#' @return Returns a vector of trait values for each taxon, with value names
#' being the taxa IDs (column 1 of the input) with a 't' pasted (as with rtree
#' in the ape library).

#' This function is similar to Brownian motion simulation functions such as
#' \code{rTraitCont} in ape, \code{sim.char} in geiger and \code{fastBM} in
#' phytools.
#' 
#' See also \code{\link{unitLengthTree}} in this package and
#' \code{speciationalTree} in the package geiger. These are tree transformation
#' functions; together with BM simulation functions, they would be expected to
#' have a similar effect as this function (when cladogenesis is 'bifurcating'
#' and not 'budding'; see above).
