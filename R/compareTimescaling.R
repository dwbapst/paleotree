#' Comparing the Time-Scaling of Trees
#' 
#' These functions take two trees and calculate the changes in node ages (for
#' compareNodeAges) for shared clades or terminal branch lengths leading to
#' shared tip taxa (for compareTermBranches).
#' 
#' @details For their most basic usage, these functions compare the time-scaling of two
#' trees. Any taxa not-shared on both trees are dropped before analysis, based
#' on tip labels.
#' 
#' As with many paleotree functions, calculations relating to time on trees are
#' done with respect to any included $root.time elements. If these are not
#' present, the latest tip is assumed to be at the present day (time = 0).
#' 
#' compareNodeAges calculates the changes in the clade ages among those clades
#' shared by the two trees, relative to the first tree in absolute time. For
#' example, a shift of +5 means the clade originates 5 time-units later in
#' absolute time on the second tree, while a shift of -5 means the clade
#' originated 5 time-units prior on the second tree.
#' 
#' For compareNodeAges, if tree2 is actually a multiPhylo object composed of
#' multiple phylogenies, the output will be a matrix, with each row
#' representing a different tree and each column a different clade shared
#' between at least some subset of the trees in tree2 and the tree in tree1.
#' values in the matrix are the changes in clade ages between from tree1 (as
#' baseline) to tree2, with NA values representing a clade that is not contained
#' in the tree represented by that row (but is contained in tree1 and at least
#' one other tree in tree2). The matrix can be reduced to only those clades
#' shared by all trees input via the argument dropUnshared. Note that this
#' function distinguishes clades based on their shared taxa, and cannot so infer
#' that two clades might be identical if it were not for single taxon within
#' the crown of one considered clade, despite that such a difference should
#' probably have no effect on compare a node divergence date. Users should
#' consider their dataset for such scenarios prior to application of
#' compareNodeAges, perhaps by dropping all taxa not included in all other
#' trees to be considered (this is NOT done by this function).
#' 
#' compareTermBranches calculates the changes in the terminal branch lengths
#' attached to tip taxa shared by the two trees, relative to the first tree.
#' Thus, a shift of +5 means that this particular terminal taxon is connected
#' to a terminal branch which is five time-units longer.


#' @aliases compareTimescaling compareNodeAges compareTermBranches

#' @param tree1 A time-scaled phylogeny of class 'phylo'

#' @param tree2 A time-scaled phylogeny of class 'phylo'; for compareNodeAges,
#' tree2 can also be an object of class 'multiPhylo' composed of multiple
#' phylogenies. See below.

#' @param dropUnshared If TRUE, nodes not shared across all input trees are
#' dropped from the final output for compareNodeAge. This argument has no
#' effect if tree2 is a single phylogeny (a 'phylo'-class object).

#' @return compareTermBranches returns a vector of temporal shifts for terminal
#' branches with the shared tip names as labels.
#' 
#' compareNodeAges, if both tree1 and tree2 are single trees, outputs a vector
#' of temporal shifts for nodes on tree2 with respect to tree1. If tree2 is
#' multiple trees, then a matrix is output, with each row representing each
#' tree in tree2 (and carrying the name of each tree, if any is given). The
#' values are temporal shifts for each tree in tree2 with respect to tree1. For
#' either case, the column names or element names (for a vector) are the sorted
#' taxon names of the particular clade, the dates of which are given in that
#' column. See above for more details. These names can be very long when large
#' trees are considered.
