\title{Nearest Neighbor Distances for Morphological Disparity Studies}
\usage{
nearestNeighborDist(distMat)
}
\arguments{
\item{distMat}{A symmetric, square pair-wise distance matrix, assumed to be a dissimilarity
matrix with a diagonal that is either zero values, \code{NA} values, or a mixture of both.
Can be a 'dist' object rather than a numerical matrix.
Taxon labels can be applied to the rows and columns
(or as labels if a 'dist' object)
and will be used to name the resulting output.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of the nearest neighbor distance for each unit (taxon) in the 
pair-wise distance matrix, named with the labels from the input distance matrix.
}
\description{
This is a simple function for obtaining nearest neighbor distance
from a symmetric pair-wises distance matrix, assumed here to be 
dissimilarities between pairs of taxa. Per-species NND is returned
rather than a mean or other summary value.
}
\details{
This function is mainly included here for pedagogical (teaching) purposes.
NND is so simple to calculate, users are urged to write their own functions
for primary research purposes.

Typically, the \emph{mean} NND for a group is reported and used to compare different
groupings of taxa (such as different time intervals, or different clades). Bootstrapping
should be used to generate confidence intervals.
}
\examples{
#example using graptolite disparity data from Bapst et al. 2012

#load data
data(graptDisparity)

#calculate mean NND
NND <- nearestNeighborDist(graptDistMat)
mean(NND)

#calculate NND for different groups

#group (clade/paraclade) coding
groupID <- graptCharMatrix[,54]+1

groupNND <- numeric(7)
names(groupNND) <- c("Normalo.","Monogr.","Climaco.",
   "Dicrano.","Lasiogr.","Diplogr.","Retiol.")
for(i in unique(groupID)){
   groupNND[i] <- mean(nearestNeighborDist(
      graptDistMat[groupID == i,groupID == i]))
   }
groupNND

#the paraphyletic Normalograptids that survived the HME are most clustered
   #but this looks at all the species at once
   #and doesn't look for the nearest *co-extant* neighbor!
   #need to bring in temporal info to test that
