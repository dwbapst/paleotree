}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{An unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa, of class \code{phylo}. Tip labels
must match the taxon labels in the respective temporal data.}

\item{timeData}{Two-column matrix of first and last occurrences in absolute
continuous time, with row names as the taxon IDs used on the tree. This means the
first column is very precise FADs (first appearance dates) and the second 
column is very precise LADs (last appearance dates), reflect the precise points
in time when taxa first and last appear. If there is stratigraphic uncertainty in
when taxa appear in the fossil record, it is preferable to use the 'bin'
time-scaling functions; however, see the argument \code{dateTreatment}.}

\item{type}{Type of time-scaling method used. Can be "basic", "equal", "equal_paleotree_legacy", "equal_date.phylo_legacy"
"aba", "zbla" or "mbl". Type = "basic" by default. See details below.}

\item{vartime}{Time variable; usage depends on the method 'type' argument.
Ignored if type = "basic".}

\item{ntrees}{Number of time-scaled trees to output. If ntrees is greater
than one and both randres is false and dateTreatment is neither
'minMax' or 'randObs', the function will fail and
a warning is issued, as these arguments would simply produce multiple
identical time-scaled trees.}

\item{randres}{Should polytomies be randomly resolved? By default,
\code{timePaleoPhy} does not resolve polytomies, instead outputting a time-scaled
tree that is only as resolved as the input tree. If \code{randres = T}, then
polytomies will be randomly resolved using \code{\link{multi2di}} from the
package ape. If \code{randres = T} and \code{ntrees = 1}, a warning is printed that users
should analyze multiple randomly-resolved trees, rather than a single such
tree, although a tree is still output.}

\item{timeres}{Should polytomies be resolved relative to the order of
appearance of lineages? By default, \code{timePaleoPhy} does not resolve
polytomies, instead outputting a time-scaled tree that is only as resolved
as the input tree. If \code{timeres = TRUE}, then polytomies will be resolved with
respect to time using the paleotree function \code{\link{timeLadderTree}}.
See that functions help page for more information; the result of time-order
resolving of polytomies generally does not differ across multiple uses,
unlike use of \code{multi2di}.}

\item{add.term}{If true, adds terminal ranges. By default, this function will
not add the ranges of taxa when time-scaling a tree, so that the tips
correspond temporally to the first appearance datums of the given taxa. If
\code{add.term = T}, then the 'terminal ranges' of the taxa are added to the tips
after tree is time-scaled, such that the tips now correspond to the last
appearance datums.}

\item{inc.term.adj}{If true, includes terminal ranges in branch length
estimates for the various adjustment of branch lengths under all methods
except 'basic' (i.e. a terminal length branch will not be treated as zero
length is this argument is \code{TRUE} if the taxon at this tip has a non-zero
duration). By default, this argument is \code{FALSE} and this function will not
include the ranges of taxa when adjusting branch lengths, so that
zero-length branches before first appearance times will be extended. An
error is returned if this argument is true but \code{type = "basic"} or
\code{add.term = FALSE}, as this argument is inconsistent with those argument
options.}

\item{dateTreatment}{This argument controls the interpretation of \code{timeData}. 
The default setting \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"} treats the dates 
in \code{timeData} as a column of precise first and last appearances. 
A second option is \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"}, which 
treats these dates as minimum and maximum bounds on single point dates. Under this option,
all taxa in the analysis will be treated as being point dates, such that the first appearance
is also the last. These dates will be pulled under a uniform distribution. If \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} is used,
\code{add.term} becomes meaningless, and the use of it will return an error message. A third option
is \code{dateTreatment = "randObs"}. This assumes that the dates in the matrix are first and last appearance times,
but that the desired time of observation is unknown. Thus, this is much like \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"} except
the effective time of observation (the taxon's LAD under
\code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"}) is treated as an uncertain date, and
is randomly sampled between the first and last appearance times. The FAD still is treated as a fixed number, used
for dating the nodes. In previous versions of paleotree, this
was called in \code{timePaleoPhy} using the argument \code{rand.obs}, which has been removed
for clarity. This temporal uncertainty in times of observation might be useful if
a user is interested in applying phylogeny-based approaches to studying trait evolution, but have
per-taxon measurements of traits that come from museum specimens with uncertain temporal placement.
With both arguments \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} and
\code{dateTreatment = "randObs"}, the sampling of dates from random distributions should
compel users to produce many time-scaled trees for any given analytical purpose.
Note that \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} returns an error in 'bin' time-scaling functions; please use
\code{points.occur} instead.}

\item{node.mins}{The minimum dates of internal nodes (clades) on a phylogeny can be set
using node.mins. This argument takes a vector of the same length as the number of nodes,
with dates given in the same order as nodes are ordered in the \code{tree$edge} matrix.
Note that in \code{tree$edge}, terminal tips are given the first set of numbers
(\code{1:Ntip(tree)}), so the first element of \code{node.mins} is the first internal node
(the node numbered \code{Ntip(tree)+1}, which is generally the root for most \code{phylo}
objects read by \code{read.tree}). Not all nodes need be given minimum dates; those without
minimum dates can be given as NA in \code{node.mins}, but the vector must be the same length
as the number of internal nodes in \code{tree}. These are minimum date constraints, such that
a node will be forced to be \emph{at least as old as this date}, but the final date may be even
older depending on the taxon dates used, the time-scaling method applied, the \code{vartime}
used and any other minimum node dates given (e.g. if a clade is given a very old minimum date,
this will (of course) over-ride any minimum dates given for clades that that node is nested
within). Although \code{vartime} does adjust the node age downwards when the equal method
is used, if a user has a specific date they'd like to constrain the root to, they should use
\code{node.mins} instead because the result is more predictable.}

\item{noisyDrop}{If \code{TRUE} (the default), any taxa dropped from tree due to not
having a matching entry in the time data will be listed in a system message.}

\item{plot}{If \code{TRUE}, plots the input and output phylogenies.}

\item{timeList}{A list composed of two matrices giving interval times and
taxon appearance dates. The rownames of the second matrix should be the taxon IDs,
identical to the \code{tip.labels} for tree. See details.}

\item{nonstoch.bin}{If \code{TRUE}, dates are not stochastically pulled from
uniform distributions. See below for more details.}

\item{sites}{Optional two column matrix, composed of site IDs for taxon FADs
and LADs. The sites argument allows users to constrain the placement of
dates by restricting multiple fossil taxa whose FADs or LADs are from the
same very temporally restricted sites (such as fossil-rich Lagerstatten) to
always have the same date, across many iterations of time-scaled trees. To
do this, simply give a matrix where the "site" of each FAD and LAD for every
taxon is listed, as corresponding to the second matrix in timeList. If no
sites matrix is given (the default), then it is assumed all fossil come from
different "sites" and there is no shared temporal structure among the
events.}

\item{point.occur}{If true, will automatically produce a 'sites' matrix
which forces all FADs and LADs to equal each other. This should be used when
all taxa are only known from single 'point occurrences', i.e. each is only
recovered from a single bed/horizon, such as a Lagerstatten.}
}
\value{
The output of these functions is a time-scaled tree or set of
time-scaled trees, of either class \code{phylo} or \code{multiphylo}, depending on the
argument ntrees. All trees are output with an element $root.time. This is
the time of the root on the tree and is important for comparing patterns
across trees. Note that the $root.time element is defined relative to the
earliest first appearance date, and thus later tips may seem to occur in
the distant future under the 'aba' and 'zbla' time-scaling methods.

Trees created with \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} will output with some additional
elements, in particular $ranges.used, a matrix which records the
continuous-time ranges generated for time-scaling each tree. (Essentially a
pseudo-\code{timeData} matrix.)
}
\description{
Time-scales an unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa using information on their
temporal ranges, using various methods. Also can resolve polytomies randomly
and output samples of randomly-resolved trees. As simple methods of time-scaling
phylogenies of fossil taxa can have biasing effects on macroevolutionary analyses
(Bapst, 2014, Paleobiology), this function is largely retained for legacy purposes
and plotting applications. The time-scaling methods implemented
by the functions listed here do \bold{not} return realistic estimates of 
divergence dates, users should investigate other time-scaling methods such as \code{\link{cal3TimePaleoPhy}}.
}
\details{
\emph{Time-Scaling Methods}

These functions are an attempt to unify and collect previously used and
discussed 'a posteriori' methods for time-scaling phylogenies of fossil taxa.
Unfortunately, it can be difficult to attribute some time-scaling methods to
specific references in the literature.

There are five main a posteriori approaches that can be used by \code{timePaleoPhy}. Four of these
main types use some value of absolute time, chosen a priori, to time-scale the tree.
This is handled by the argument \code{vartime}, which is NULL by default and unused
for type "basic".

\describe{
 \item{"basic"}{This most simple of time-scaling methods ignores \code{vartime} and
scales nodes so they are as old as the first appearance of their oldest
descendant (Smith, 1994). This method produces many zero-length branches
(Hunt and Carrano, 2010).}
 \item{"equal"}{The 'equal' method defined by G. Lloyd and used in Brusatte
et al. (2008) and Lloyd et al. (2012). Originally usable in code supplied by
G. Lloyd, the algorithm is recreated here as closely as possible. This method
works by increasing the time of the root divergence by some amount and then
adjusting zero-length branches so that time on early branches is re-apportioned
out along those later branches equally. Branches are adjusted in order relative
to the number of nodes separating the edge from the root, going from the furthest
(most shallow) edges to the deepest edges. The choice of ordering algorithm can have
an unanticipated large effect on the resulting time-scaled trees created using "equal"
and it appears that paleotree and functions written by G. Lloyd were not always consistent.
The default option described here was only introduced into either software sources in
August 2014. Thus, two legacy 'equal' methods are included in this function, so users can
emulate older ordering algorithms for 'equal' which are now deprecated, as they do not
match the underlying logic of the original 'equal' algorithm and do not minimize down-passes
when adjusting branch lengths on the time-scaled tree.

The root age can be adjusted backwards in time by either increasing by
an arbitrary amount (via the \code{vartime}  argument) or by setting the
root age directly (via the \code{node.mins} argument); conversely, the
function will also allow a user to opt to not alter the root age at all.}
\item{"equal_paleotree_legacy"}{Exactly like 'equal' above, except that edges are ordered instead
by their depth (i.e. number of nodes from the root). This minor modified version
was referred to as 'equal' for this \code{timePaleoPhy} function in \code{paleotree} until February 2014, and thus is
included here solely for legacy purposes. This ordering algorithm does not minimize branch adjustment cycles,
like the newer default offered under currently 'equal'.}
\item{"equal_date.phylo_legacy"}{Exactly like 'equal' above, except that edges are ordered relative
to their time (ie. total edge length) from the root following the application of the 'basic'
time-scaling method, exactly as in G. Lloyd's original application. This was the method for sorting
edges in the "equal" algorithm in G. Lloyd's \code{date.phylo} script and \code{DatePhylo} in
package \code{strap} until August 2014, and was the default "equal" algorithm in \code{paleotree}'s \code{timePaleoPhy}
function from February 2014 until August 2014.  This ordering algorithm does not minimize branch adjustment cycles,
like the newer default offered under currently 'equal'. Due to how the presence of zero-length
branches can make ordering branches based on time to be very unpredictable, this version of the 'equal'
algorithm is \bold{highly not recommended}.}
\item{"aba"}{All branches additive. This method takes the "basic" tree and
adds vartime to all branches. Note that this time-scaling method can warp the
tree structure, leading to tips to originate out of order with the appearance
data used.}
\item{"zlba"}{Zero-length branches additive. This method adds vartime to all
zero-length branches in the "basic" tree. Discussed (possibly?) by Hunt and Carrano,
2010.Note that this time-scaling method can warp the
tree structure, leading to tips to originate out of order with the appearance
data used.}
\item{"mbl"}{Minimum branch length. Scales all branches so they are
greater than or equal to vartime, and subtract time added to later branches
from earlier branches in order to maintain the temporal structure of events.
A version of this was first introduced by Laurin (2004).} }

These functions cannot time-scale branches relative to reconstructed
character changes along branches, as used by Lloyd et al. (2012). Please
see \code{DatePhylo} in R package \code{strap} for this functionality.

These functions will intuitively drop taxa from the tree with NA for range
or are missing from \code{timeData} or \code{timeList}. Taxa dropped from the tree will be
will be listed in a message output to the user. The same is done for taxa in
the \code{timeList} object not listed in the tree.

As with many functions in the \code{paleotree} library, absolute time is always
decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.

As of August 2014, please note that the branch-ordering algorithm used in 'equal' has changed
to match the current algorithm used by \code{DatePhylo} in package \code{strap}, and that two legacy
versions of 'equal' have been added to this function, respectively representing how \code{timePaleoPhy}
and \code{DatePhylo} (and its predecessor \code{date.phylo}) applied the 'equal' time-scaling method.

\emph{Interpretation of Taxon Ages in timePaleoPhy}

\code{timePaleoPhy} is \emph{primarily} designed for direct application to datasets where taxon first 
and last appearances are precisely known in continuous time, with no stratigraphic
uncertainty. This is an uncommon form of data to have from the fossil record, 
although not an impossible form (micropaleontologists often have very precise 
range charts, for example). Instead, most data has some form of stratigraphic uncertainty. However, for some groups,
the more typical 'first' and 'last' dates found in the literature or in databases represent the minimum
and maximum absolute ages for the fossil collections that a taxon is known
is known from. Presumably, the first and last appearances of that taxon in
the fossil record is at unknown dates within these bounds. 

As of paleotree version 2.0. the treatment of taxon ages in
\code{timePaleoPhy} is handled by the argument \code{dateTreatment}.
\emph{By default,} this argument is set to 'firstLast' which means the matrix of ages are treated
as precise first and last appearance dates (i.e. FADs and LADs). The earlier FADs will be used
to calibrate the node ages, which could produce fairly nonsensical results if these are 'minimum'
ages instead and reflect age uncertainty. Alternatively, \code{dateTreatment} can be set to 'minMax'
which instead treats taxon age data as minimum and maximum bounds on a single point date. 
These point dates, if the minimum and maximum bounds option is selected,
are chose under a uniform distribution. Many time-scaled trees should be created to approximate
the uncertainty in the dates. Additionally, there is a third option for \code{dateTreatment}:
users may also make it so that the 'times of observation'
of trees are uncertain, such that the tips of the tree (with terminal ranges added) should
be randomly selected from a uniform distribution. Essentially, this third option treats the
dates as first and last appearances, but treats the first appearance dates as known and
fixed, but the 'last appearance' dates as unknown. In previous versions of paleotree,
this third option was enacted with the argument \code{rand.obs}, which has been removed for
clarity.

\emph{Interpretation of Taxon Ages in bin_timePaleoPhy}

As an alternative to using \code{timePaleoPhy}, \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} is a wrapper of 
\code{timePaleoPhy} which produces time-scaled trees for datasets which only have 
interval data available. For each output tree, taxon first and last appearance 
dates are placed within their listed intervals under a uniform distribution. 
Thus, a large sample of time-scaled trees will approximate the uncertainty in 
the actual timing of the FADs and LADs. In some ways, treating taxonomic age uncertainty
may be more logical via \code{bin_timePaleoPhy}, as it is tied to specific interval bounds,
and there are more options available for certain types of age uncertainty, such as for cases
where specimens come from the same fossil site.

The input \code{timeList} object for \code{bin_timePaleoPhy} can have overlapping
(i.e. non-sequential) intervals, and intervals of uneven size. Taxa alive in the modern should be listed as last 
occurring in a time interval that begins at time 0 and ends at time 0. If taxa 
occur only in single collections (i.e. their first and last appearance in the 
fossil record is synchronous, the argument point.occur will force all taxa
to have instantaneous durations in the fossil record. Otherwise, by default,
taxa are assumed to first and last appear in the fossil record at different points
in time, with some positive duration. The sites matrix can be used to force
only a portion of taxa to have simultaneous first and last appearances.

By setting the argument nonstoch.bin to TRUE for \code{bin_timePaleoPhy}, the dates are NOT
stochastically pulled from uniform bins but instead FADs are assigned to the
earliest time of whichever interval they were placed in and LADs are placed
at the most recent time in their placed interval. This option may be useful
for plotting. The sites argument becomes arbitrary if \code{nonstoch.bin = TRUE}.

If \code{timeData} or the elements of \code{timeList} are actually \code{data.frames} (as output
by \code{read.csv} or \code{read.table}), these will be coerced to a matrix.

\note{
Please account for stratigraphic uncertainty in your analysis.
Unless you have exceptionally resolved data, select an appropriate option in
\code{dateTreatment} within \code{timePaleoPhy}, use the more sophisticated
\code{bin_timePaleoPhy} or code your own wrapper function of \code{timePaleoPhy}
that accounts for stratigraphic uncertainty in your dataset.

For an alternative time-scaling function, which includes the 'ruta' method
that weights the time-scaling of branches by estimates of character change
along with implementations of the 'basic' and 'equal' methods described here,
please see function \code{DatePhylo} in package \code{strap}.
