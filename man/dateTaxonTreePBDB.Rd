\title{Date a Taxon-Topology from the Paleobiology Database Using Appearance Data from the API}
\usage{
dateTaxonTreePBDB(taxaTree, taxaDataPBDB = taxaTree$taxaDataPBDB,
  minBranchLen = 0, tipTaxonDateUsed = "shallowestAge",
  plotTree = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{taxaTree}{A tree with tip taxon names matching the taxon names
in \code{taxaDataPBDB}. Probably a taxon tree estimated
with \code{\link{makePBDBtaxonTree}}.}

\item{taxaDataPBDB}{A data table of taxonomic information obtained
using the Paleobiology Database's API for a set of taxa that
includes the tip taxa on \code{taxaTree}, generated with
parameter \code{show = app} so that appearance times are included.}

\item{minBranchLen}{Following dating using the appearance times taken directly
from the PBDB for each tip taxon and node, the tree may then be assessed with
the minimum branch length algorithm, as applied by \code{\link{minBranchLength}}.
If \code{minBranchLen = 0}, the default, this step is skipped. It may be necessary
to set \code{minBranchLen} higher than zero to differentiate nodes in cases
with poor stratigraphic congruency, so that derived taxa are the first taxa
observed in a group.}

\item{tipTaxonDateUsed}{Controls what date for a taxon from the PBDB
is used for 'when' the tip should be placed in the dated phylogeny
produced by this function. The default, \code{tipTaxonDateUsed = "shallowestAge"}
will use the minimum age of the last appearance time of that taxon, which if it
is extant will be 0, and if it is extinct, will be the maximum constraint on the
age of its last appearance (i.e. the last time we saw it before it went extinct).
Other options are "deepestAge", which is the oldest possible first appearance time
from the PBDB, i.e. the maximum age constraint for the first appearance. As closely
related taxa often first occur in the same short interval of geologic time, due to
diversification bursts and/or the heterogeneity of fossil preservation, this may
result in confusing polytomies of many terminal taxa with no terminal branch lengths.}

\item{plotTree}{If \code{TRUE}, the resulting dated tree is plotted.
This is \code{FALSE} by default.}
}
\value{
Returns a dated phylogeny of class \code{phylo}, with an additional element
\code{$taxaDataPBDB} added containing the input \code{taxaDataPBDB}, as this might be
called by other functions.

The function \code{dateTaxonTreePBDB} takes a topology of  
The required input is a topology with tip and internal node labels corresponding to taxa in the Paleobiology Database, and a table of data (containing those same tip and node taxa) obtained from the taxa-list functionality of the Paleobiology Database's API, with appearance times output.
