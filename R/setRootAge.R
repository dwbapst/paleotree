#' Place a Non-Ultrametric Tree of Fossil Taxa on Absolute Time
#' 
#' This function uses a table of fixed dates for operational-taxon-units (tip taxa) to calculate the absolute
#' age of the root divergence for a tree with branch lengths, and then appends this root age to the tree
#' as a \code{$root.time} element, and then outputs the tree. Function \code{setRootAges} is a wrapper for
#' \code{setRootAge} for use with multiple trees in a "multiPhylo" object. This function was mainly written for
#' dealing with trees of extinct taxa dated in units of absolute time from Bayesian analyses, such as with MrBayes, 
#' with trees scaled to time units by functions such as \code{\link{obtainDatedPosteriorTreesMrB}}.

#' @details
#' Trees of fossil taxa come with one issue rarely encountered by those dealing with molecular
#' phylogenies: the absolute timing of when tips and divergences is not certain. With the vast
#' majority of molecular phylogenies, it can be assumed the youngest tips occur at 0 time -- i.e.,
#' the modern. This knowledge gives the tree an anchor for figuring out the absolute timing of events.
#' Many programs and other software designed for depicting and analyzing phylogenetic hypotheses
#' assumes such an apparent absolute time-scale (in R and elsewhere). A tree of Paleozoic brachiopods that include no
#' extant members has no such anchor at time = 0, and such a default assumption in available
#' software can be misleading. The $root.time protocol is intended to grant this
#' absolute time-scale to a dated tree of fossil taxa, and is appended by most of the
#' dating functions in package paleotree. However, trees dated by other approaches, such as via tip-dating in
#' programs such as MrBayes and BEAST, will not have $root.time elements when read into R.
#' 

#' @param tree A phylogeny with branch lengths of type "phylo".

#' @param trees A list of type "multiPhylo" consisting of multiple phylogenetic trees with branch lengths.

#' @param fixedAges A table of fixed ages for tip taxa, generally as a dataframe where the
#' first column is of type character, and the second column is of type numeric.  = Such a table is automatically
#' generated as an attribute of the output from \code{\link{obtainDatedPosteriorTreesMrB}}, 
#' when argument \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE}.

#' @return
#' The input tree is output, with a new \code{$root.time} element.

#' @seealso
#' \code{setRootAges} is designed to work by default with trees on relative
#' time-scales dated by \code{\link{obtainDatedPosteriorTreesMrB}}, particularly
#' when the argument with \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE}, which is used to obtain fixed tip
#' ages for anchoring the tree against an absolute time-scale. The functions described here
#' will be applied automatically with \code{\link{obtainDatedPosteriorTreesMrB}}
#' if argument \code{getRootAges = TRUE}.
