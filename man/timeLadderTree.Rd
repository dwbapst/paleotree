\title{Resolve Polytomies by Order of First Appearance}
\usage{
timeLadderTree(tree, timeData)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylo object}

\item{timeData}{Two-column matrix of per-taxon first and last occurrences in
absolute continuous time.}
}
\value{
Returns the modified tree as an object of class phylo, with no edge
lengths.
}
\description{
Resolves polytomies in trees with lineages arranged in a pectinate pattern
(i.e. a ladder-like subtree), ordered by the time of first appearance (FAD)
for each lineage.
}
\details{
This method of resolving polytomies assumes that the order of stratigraphic
appearance perfectly depicts the order of branching. This may not be a good
assumption for poorly sampled fossil records.

This function is for resolving trees when a continuous time-scale is known.
For discrete time-scales, see the function bin_timePaleoPhy.

Taxa with the same identical first appearance date will be ordered randomly.
Thus, the output is slightly stochastic, but only when ties exist. This is
probably uncommon with real data on continuous time-scales.

Taxa not shared between the tree and the timeData matrix, or listed as
having a FAD or LAD of NA in timeData will be dropped and will not be
included in the output tree.
