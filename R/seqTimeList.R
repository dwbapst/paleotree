#' Construct a Stochastic Sequenced Time-List from an Unsequenced Time-List
#'
#' This function randomly samples from a timeList object (i.e. a list composed of a matrix of interval start and end
#' dates and a matrix of taxon first and last intervals), to find a set of taxa and intervals that do not overlap,
#' output as a new timeList object.

#' @details
#' Many analyses of diversification and sampling in the fossil record require a dataset composed of sequential non-overlapping intervals,
#' but the nature of the geologic record often makes this difficult, with taxa from different regions, environments and sedimentary basins
#' having first and last appearances placed in entirely in-congruent systems of chronostratigraphic intervals. While one option is to convert
#' such occurrences to a single, global stratigraphic system, this may still result in overlapping intervals when fossil collections are poorly
#' constrained stratigraphically. (For example, this may often be the case in global datasets.) 

#' This function offers an approach to avoid this issue in large datasets by randomly subsampling
#' the available taxa and intervals to produce stochastic
#' sets of ranges composed of data drawn from non-overlapping intervals. 
#'
#' This function is stochastic and thus should be set for many runs to produce many such solutions. Additionally,
#' all solutions found are returned, and users may wish to sort amongst these to maximize the number of intervals and 
#' number of taxa returned. A single solution which maximizes returned taxa and intervals may not be a precise enough approach
#' to estimating sampling rates, however, given the uncertainty in data. Thus, many runs should always be considered.
#'
#' By default, solutions are searched for without consideration to the length of intervals used (i.e. the selection of intervals is 'unweighted').
#' Alternatively, we can 'weight' selection toward the smallest intervals in the set, using the argument \code{weightSampling}. Smaller
#' intervals presumably overlap less and thus should retain more taxa and intervals of more equal length. However, in practice with empirical datasets,
#' the package author finds these approaches do not seem to produce very different estimates.
#'
#' For some datasets, many solutions found using seqTimeList may return infinite sampling values. This is often due to saving too many taxa
#' found in single intervals to the exclusion of longer-ranging taxa (see the example). This excess of single interval taxa is a clear artifact
#' of the randomized seqTimeList procedure and such solutions should probably be ignored.
 
#' @param timeList A list composed of two matrices, giving interval start and end 
#' dates and taxon first and last occurrences within those intervals. Some intervals
#' are expected to overlap (thus necessitating the use of this function), and datasets
#' lacking overlapping intervals will return an error message.

#' @param nruns Number of new timeList composed of non-overlapping intervals produced.

#' @param weightSampling If TRUE, weight sampling of new intervals toward smaller intervals. FALSE by default.

#' @return
#' A list, composed of three elements: \code{nIntervals} which is a vector of the
#' number of intervals in each solution, \code{nTaxa} which is a vector of the number of
#' taxa in each solution and \code{timeLists} which is a list composed of each new
#' timeList object as an element.

#' @seealso 
#' Resulting time-lists can be analyzed with \code{\link{freqRat}}, \code{\link{durationFreq}}, etc.
#' 
#' Additionally, \code{\link{binTimeData}} can be useful for simulating interval data.
