\title{Comparing the Time-Scaling of Trees}
\usage{
compareNodeAges(tree1, tree2, dropUnshared = FALSE)

compareTermBranches(tree1, tree2)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree1}{A time-scaled phylogeny of class 'phylo'}

\item{tree2}{A time-scaled phylogeny of class 'phylo'; for compareNodeAges,
tree2 can also be an object of class 'multiPhylo' composed of multiple
phylogenies. See below.}

\item{dropUnshared}{If TRUE, nodes not shared across all input trees are
dropped from the final output for compareNodeAge. This argument has no
effect if tree2 is a single phylogeny (a 'phylo'-class object).}
}
\value{
compareTermBranches returns a vector of temporal shifts for terminal
branches with the shared tip names as labels.

compareNodeAges, if both tree1 and tree2 are single trees, outputs a vector
of temporal shifts for nodes on tree2 with respect to tree1. If tree2 is
multiple trees, then a matrix is output, with each row representing each
tree in tree2 (and carrying the name of each tree, if any is given). The
values are temporal shifts for each tree in tree2 with respect to tree1. For
either case, the column names or element names (for a vector) are the sorted
taxon names of the particular clade, the dates of which are given in that
column. See above for more details. These names can be very long when large
trees are considered.

\description{
These functions take two trees and calculate the changes in node ages (for
compareNodeAges) for shared clades or terminal branch lengths leading to
shared tip taxa (for compareTermBranches).
}
\details{
For their most basic usage, these functions compare the time-scaling of two
trees. Any taxa not-shared on both trees are dropped before analysis, based
on tip labels.

As with many paleotree functions, calculations relating to time on trees are
done with respect to any included $root.time elements. If these are not
present, the latest tip is assumed to be at the present day (time = 0).

compareNodeAges calculates the changes in the clade ages among those clades
shared by the two trees, relative to the first tree in absolute time. For
example, a shift of +5 means the clade originates 5 time-units later in
absolute time on the second tree, while a shift of -5 means the clade
originated 5 time-units prior on the second tree.

For compareNodeAges, if tree2 is actually a multiPhylo object composed of
multiple phylogenies, the output will be a matrix, with each row
representing a different tree and each column a different clade shared
between at least some subset of the trees in tree2 and the tree in tree1.
values in the matrix are the changes in clade ages between from tree1 (as
baseline) to tree2, with NA values representing a clade that is not contained
in the tree represented by that row (but is contained in tree1 and at least
one other tree in tree2). The matrix can be reduced to only those clades
shared by all trees input via the argument dropUnshared. Note that this
function distinguishes clades based on their shared taxa, and cannot so infer
that two clades might be identical if it were not for single taxon within
the crown of one considered clade, despite that such a difference should
probably have no effect on compare a node divergence date. Users should
consider their dataset for such scenarios prior to application of
compareNodeAges, perhaps by dropping all taxa not included in all other
trees to be considered (this is NOT done by this function).

compareTermBranches calculates the changes in the terminal branch lengths
attached to tip taxa shared by the two trees, relative to the first tree.
Thus, a shift of +5 means that this particular terminal taxon is connected
to a terminal branch which is five time-units longer.
