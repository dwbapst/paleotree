#' Construct A Block of Tip Age Calibrations for Use with Tip-Dating Analyses in MrBayes
#' 
#' Takes a set of tip ages (in several possible forms, see below),
#' and outputs a set of tip age calibrations
#' for use with tip-dating analyses (sensu Zhang et al., 2016)
#' in the popular phylogenetics program \emph{MrBayes}.
#' These calibrations are printed as a set of character strings, as well as a 
#' line placing an offset exponential prior on the tree age, either
#' printed in the R console or in a named text file, which can be used as
#' commands in the \emph{MrBayes} block of a NEXUS file for use with 
#' (you guessed it!) \emph{MrBayes}.

#' @details
#' Beware: some combinations of arguments might not make sense for your data.
#' 
#' (But that's always true, is it not?)

#' @param tipTimes This input may be either a timeList object (i.e. a list of length 2, 
#' composed of a table of interval upper and lower time boundaries (i.e. earlier and latter bounds), and 
#' a table of first and last intervals for taxa) or a matrix with rownames
#' for taxa as you want listed in the MrBayes block, with either one, two
#' or four columns containing ages (respectively) for point occurrences with
#' precise dates (for a single column), uncertainty bounds on a point occurrence
#' (for two columns), or uncertainty bounds on the first and
#' last occurrence (for four columns). Note that precise first and last occurrence
#' dates should not be entered as a two column matrix, as this will instead be interpreted
#' as uncertainty bounds on a single occurrence. Instead, either select which you want to
#' use for tip-dates and give a 1-column matrix, or repeat (and collate) the columns, so that
#' the first and last appearances has uncertainty bounds of zero.

#' @param whichAppearance Which appearance date of the taxa should be used:
#' their \code{'first'} or their \code{'last'} appearance date? The default
#' option is to use the 'first' appearance date. Note that use of the last
#' appearance date means that tips will be constrained to occur before their
#' last occurrence, and thus could occur long after their first occurrence (!).

#' @param ageCalibrationType This argument decides how age calibrations are defined, 
#' and currently allows for four options: \code{"fixedDateEarlier"} which fixes tip
#' ages at the earlier (lower) bound for the selected age of appearance (see argument
#' \code{whichAppearance} for how that selection is made), \code{"fixedDateLatter"}
#' which fixes the date to the latter (upper) bound of the selected age of appearance,
#' \code{"fixedDateRandom"} which fixes tips to a date that is randomly drawn from a
#' uniform distribution bounded by the upper and lower bounds on the selected age of
#' appearance, or (the recommended option) \code{"uniformRange"} which places a uniform
#' prior on the age of the tip, bounded by the latest and earliest (upper and lower)
#' bounds on the the selected age.

#' @param treeAgeOffset A parameter given by the user controlling the offset 
#' between the minimum and expected tree age prior. mean tree age for the
#' offset exponential prior on tree age will be set to the minimum tree age, 
#' plus this offset value. Thus, an offset of 10 million years would equate to a prior
#' assuming that the expected tree age is around 10 million years before the minimum age.

#' @param minTreeAge if \code{NULL} (the default), then minTreeAge will
#' be set as the oldest date among the tip age used (those used being
#' determine by user choices (or oldest bound on a tip age). Otherwise,
#' the user can supply their own minimum tree, which must be greater than
#' whatever the oldest tip age used is.

#' @param collapseUniform MrBayes won't accept uniform age priors where the maximum and
#' minimum age are identical (i.e. its actually a fixed age). Thus, if this argument
#' is \code{TRUE} (the default), this function
#' will treat any taxon ages where the maximum and minimum are identical as a fixed age, and
#' will override setting \code{ageCalibrationType = "uniformRange"} for those dates.
#' All taxa with their ages set to fixed by the behavior of \code{anchorTaxon} or \code{collapseUniform}
#' are returned as a list within a commented line of the returned MrBayes block.

#' @param anchorTaxon This argument may be a logical (default is \code{TRUE},
#' or a character string of length = 1.
#' This argument has no effect if \code{ageCalibrationType} is not set to
#' \code{"uniformRange"}, but the argument may still be evaluated.
#' If \code{ageCalibrationType = "uniformRange"}, 
#' MrBayes will do a tip-dating analysis with uniform age uncertainties on 
#' all taxa (if such uncertainties exist; see \code{collapseUniform}). 
#' However, MrBayes does not record how each tree sits on an absolute time-scale,
#' so if the placement of \emph{every} tip is uncertain, lining up multiple dated trees
#'  sampled from the posterior (where each tip's true age might
#' differ) could be a nightmare to back-calculate, if not impossible. 
#' Thus, if \code{ageCalibrationType = "uniformRange"}, and there are no tip taxa given
#' fixed dates due to \code{collapseUniform} (i.e. all of the tip ages have a range of uncertainty on them), 
#' then a particular taxon will be selected and given a fixed date equal to its
#' earliest appearance time for its respective \code{whichAppearance}.
#' This taxon can either be indicated by the user or instead the first taxon listed
#' in \code{tipTimes} will be arbitrary selected. All taxa with their ages set
#' to fixed by the behavior of \code{anchorTaxon} or \code{collapseUniform}
#' are returned as a list within a commented line of the returned MrBayes block.

#' @param file Filename (possibly with path) as a character string
#' to a file which will be overwritten with the output tip age calibrations.
#' If \code{NULL}, tip calibration commands are output to the console.

#' @return
#' If argument \code{file} is \code{NULL}, then the tip age commands
#' are output as a series of character strings.
#' 
#' All taxa with their ages set to fixed by the behavior of \code{anchorTaxon} or \code{collapseUniform}
#' are returned as a list within a commented line of the returned MrBayes block.
