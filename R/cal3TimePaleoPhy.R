#' Three Rate Calibrated 'a posteriori' Time-Scaling of Paleo-Phylogenies
#' 
#' Time-scales an unscaled cladogram of fossil taxa, using information on their
#' ranges and estimates of the instantaneous rates of branching, extinction and
#' sampling. The output is a sample of a posteriori time-scaled trees, as resulting from a
#' stochastic algorithm which samples observed gaps in the fossil record with
#' weights calculated based on the input rate estimates. This function also
#' uses the three-rate calibrated time-scaling algorithm to stochastically
#' resolve polytomies and infer potential ancestor-descendant relationships,
#' simultaneous with the time-scaling treatment.
#' 
#' @details The three-rate calibrated ("cal3") algorithm time-scales trees a posteriori by
#' stochastically picking node divergence times relative to a probability
#' distribution of expected waiting times between speciation and first
#' appearance in the fossil record. This algorithm is extended to apply to
#' resolving polytomies and designating possible ancestor-descendant
#' relationships. The full details of this method are provided in Bapst (2013, MEE).
#' 
#' Briefly, cal3 time-scaling is done by examining each node separately, moving
#' from the root upwards. Ages of branching nodes are constrained below by the
#' ages of the nodes below them (except the root; hence the need for the
#' root.max argument) and constrained above by the first appearance dates
#' (FADs) of the daughter lineages. The position of the branching event within
#' this constrained range implies different amounts of unobserved evolutionary
#' history. cal3 considers a large number of potential positions for the
#' branching node (the notation in the code uses the analogy of viewing the
#' branching event as a 'zipper') and calculates the summed unobserved
#' evolutionary history implied by each branching time. The probability density
#' of each position is then calculated under a gamma distribution with a shape
#' parameter of 2 (implying that it is roughly the sum of two normal waiting
#' times under an exponential) and a rate parameter which takes into account
#' both the probability of not observing a lineage of a certain duration and
#' the 'twiginess' of the branch, i.e. the probability of having short-lived
#' descendants which went extinct and never were sampled (ala Friedman and
#' Brazeau, 2011). These densities calculated under the gamma distribution are
#' then used as weights to stochastically sample the possible positions for the
#' branching node. This basic framework is extended to polytomies by allowing a
#' branching event to fall across multiple potential lineages, adding each
#' lineage one by one, from earliest appearing to latest appearing (the code
#' notation refers to this as a 'parallel zipper').
#' 
#' As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
#' decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.
#' 
#' These functions will intuitively drop taxa from the tree with NA for range
#' or that are missing from timeData.
#' 
#' The sampling rate used by cal3 methods is the instantaneous sampling rate,
#' as estimated by various other function in the paleotree package. See
#' \code{\link{make_durationFreqCont}} for more details.
#' If you have the per-time unit sampling
#' probability ('R' as opposed to 'r') look at the sampling parameter
#' conversion functions also included in this package
#' (e.g. \code{\link{sProb2sRate}}). Most datasets will probably use
#' \code{\link{make_durationFreqDisc}} and \code{sProb2sRate}
#' prior to using this function, as shown in an example below.
#' 
#' The branching and extinction rate are the 'per-capita' instantaneous
#' origination/extinction rates for the taxic level of the tips of the tree
#' being time-scaled. Any user of the cal3 time-scaling method has multiple
#' options for estimating these rates. One is to separately calculate the
#' per-capita rates (following the equations in Foote, 2001) across multiple
#' intervals and take the mean for each rate. A second, less preferred option,
#' would be to use the extinction rate calculated from the sampling rate above
#' (under ideal conditions, this should be very close to the mean 'per-capita'
#' rate calculated from by-interval FADs and LADs). The branching rate in this
#' case could be assumed to be very close to the extinction rate, given the
#' tight relationship observed in general between these two (Stanley, 1976; see
#' Foote et al., 1999, for a defense of this approach), and thus the extinction
#' rate estimate could be used also for the branching rate estimate. (This is
#' what is done for the examples below.) A third option for calculating all
#' three rates simultaneously would be to apply likelihood methods developed by
#' Foote (2002) to forward and reverse survivorship curves. Note that only one
#' of these three suggested methods is implemented in \code{paleotree}: estimating the
#' sampling and extinction rates from the distribution of taxon durations via
#' \code{make_durationFreqCont} and \code{make_durationFreqDisc}.
#' 
#' By default, the cal3 functions will consider that ancestor-descendant
#' relationships may exist among the given taxa, under a budding cladogenetic
#' or anagenetic modes. Which tips are designated as which is given by two
#' additional elements added to the output tree, $budd.tips (taxa designated as
#' ancestors via budding cladogenesis) and $anag.tips (taxa designated as
#' ancestors via anagenesis). This can be turned off by setting \code{anc.wt = 0}. As
#' this function may infer anagenetic relationships during time-scaling, this
#' can create zero-length terminal branches in the output. Use
#' \code{\link{dropZLB}} to get rid of these before doing analyses of lineage
#' diversification.
#' 
#' Unlike \code{timePaleoPhy}, cal3 methods will always resolve polytomies. In
#' general, this is done using the rate calibrated algorithm, although if
#' argument \code{randres = TRUE}, polytomies will be randomly resolved with uniform
#' probability, ala \code{multi2di} from ape. Also, cal3 will always add the terminal
#' ranges of taxa. However, because of the ability to infer potential
#' ancestor-descendant relationships, the length of terminal branches may be
#' shorter than taxon ranges themselves, as budding may have occurred during
#' the range of a morphologically static taxon. By resolving polytomies with
#' the cal3 method, this function allows for taxa to be ancestral to more than
#' one descendant taxon. Thus, users who believe their dataset may contain
#' indirect ancestors are encouraged by the package author to try cal3 methods
#' with their consensus trees, as opposed to using the set of most parsimonious
#' trees. Comparing the results of these two approaches may be very revealing.
#' 
#' Like \code{timePaleoPhy}, \code{cal3TimePaleoPhy} is designed for direct application to datasets 
#' where taxon first and last appearances are precisely known in continuous time, with 
#' no stratigraphic uncertainty. This is an uncommon form of data to have from the fossil record, 
#' although not an impossible form (micropaleontologists often have very precise 
#' range charts, for example). This means that most users \emph{should not} use \code{cal3TimePaleoPhy} directly, 
#' unless they have written their own code to deal with stratigraphic uncertainty. For
#' some groups, the more typical 'first' and 'last' dates represent the minimum
#' and maximum absolute ages for the fossil collections that a taxon is known
#' is known from. Presumably, the first and last appearances of that taxon in
#' the fossil record is at unknown dates within these bounds. These should not
#' be mistaken as the FADs and LADs desired by \code{cal3TimePaleoPhy}, as \code{cal3TimePaleoPhy} 
#' will use the earliest dates provided to calibrate node ages, which is either
#' an overly conservative approach to time-scaling or fairly nonsensical.
#'
#' Alternatively to using \code{cal3TimePaleoPhy}, \code{bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy} is a wrapper of 
#' \code{cal3TimePaleoPhy} which produces time-scaled trees for datasets which only have 
#' interval data available. For each output tree, taxon first and last appearance 
#' dates are placed within their listed intervals under a uniform distribution. 
#' Thus, a large sample of time-scaled trees will approximate the uncertainty in 
#' the actual timing of the FADs and LADs. 
#'
#' The input \code{timeList} object can have overlapping (i.e. non-sequential) intervals,
#' and intervals of uneven size. Taxa alive in the modern should be listed as last 
#' occurring in a time interval that begins at time 0 and ends at time 0. If taxa 
#' occur only in single collections (i.e. their first and last appearance in the 
#' fossil record is synchronous, the argument point.occur will force all taxa
#' to have instantaneous durations in the fossil record. Otherwise, by default,
#' taxa are assumed to first and last appear in the fossil record at different points
#' in time, with some positive duration. The sites matrix can be used to force
#' only a portion of taxa to have simultaneous first and last appearances.
#'
#' By setting the argument \code{nonstoch.bin} to \code{TRUE} in \code{bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy}, the
#' dates are NOT stochastically pulled from uniform bins but instead FADs are
#' assigned to the earliest time of whichever interval they were placed in and
#' LADs are placed at the most recent time in their placed interval. This
#' option may be useful for plotting. The sites argument becomes arbitrary if
#' nonstoch.bin is \code{TRUE}.
#' 
#' If \code{timeData} or the elements of \code{timeList} are actually data frames (as output
#' by \code{read.csv} or \code{read.table}), these will be coerced to a matrix.

#' @inheritParams timePaleoPhy

#' @param brRate Either a single estimate of the instantaneous rate of branching
#' (also known as the 'per-capita' origination rate, or speciation rate if
#' taxonomic level of interest is species) or a vector of per-taxon estimates
#' @param extRate Either a single estimate of the instantaneous extinction rate
#' (also known as the 'per-capita' extinction rate) or a vector of per-taxon
#' estimates
#' @param sampRate Either a single estimate of the instantaneous sampling rate or
#' a vector of per-taxon estimates

#' @param ntrees Number of time-scaled trees to output

#' @param anc.wt Weighting against inferring ancestor-descendant relationships.
#' The argument anc.wt allows users to change the default consideration of
#' anc-desc relationships. This value is used as a multiplier applied to the
#' probability of choosing any node position which would infer an
#' ancestor-descendant relationship. By default, anc.wt = 1, and thus these
#' probabilities are unaltered. if anc.wt is less than 1, the probabilities
#' decrease and at anc.wt = 0, no ancestor-descendant relationships are inferred
#' at all. Can be a single value or a vector of per-taxon values, such as if a
#' user wants to only allow plesiomorphic taxa to be ancestors.

#' @param dateTreatment This argument controls the interpretation of \code{timeData}.
#' The default setting \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"} treats the dates
#' in \code{timeData} as a column of precise first and last appearances.
#' A second option is \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"}, which
#' treats these dates as minimum and maximum bounds on single point dates. Under this option,
#' all taxa in the analysis will be treated as being point dates, such that the first appearance
#' is also the last. These dates will be pulled under a uniform distribution.
#' If \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} is used,
#' \code{FAD.only} and  becomes meaningless, and the use of it will return an error message. 
#' A third option is \code{dateTreatment = "randObs"}. This assumes
#' that the dates in the matrix are first and last appearance times,
#' but that the desired time of observation is unknown.
#' Thus, this is much like \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"} except
#' the effective time of observation (the taxon's LAD under
#' \code{dateTreatment = "firstLast"}) is treated as an uncertain date, and
#' is randomly sampled between the first and last appearance times.
#' The FAD still is treated as a fixed number, used
#' for dating the nodes. In previous versions of paleotree, this
#' was called in \code{cal3timePaleoPhy} using the argument \code{rand.obs}, which has been removed
#' for clarity. This temporal uncertainty in times of observation might be useful if
#' a user is interested in applying phylogeny-based approaches to studying trait evolution, but have
#' per-taxon measurements of traits that come from museum
#' specimens with uncertain temporal placement.
#' With both arguments \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} and
#' \code{dateTreatment = "randObs"}, the sampling of dates from random distributions should
#' compel users to produce many time-scaled trees for any given analytical purpose.
#' Note that  \code{dateTreatment = "minMax"} returns an error
#' in 'bin' time-scaling functions; please use
#' \code{points.occur} instead.

# @param rand.obs Should the tips represent observation times uniform
# distributed within taxon ranges? This only impacts the location of tip-dates, 
# i.e. the 'times of observation' for taxa, and does not impact the dates used to 
# determine node ages. Thus, this is an alternative to using only the LADs or only the FADs
# as the per-taxon times of observation. If rand.obs is TRUE, then it is assumed
# that users wish the tips to represent observations made with some temporal
# uncertainty, such that they might have come from any point within a taxon's
# known range.  This might be the case, for example, if a user is interested in
# applying phylogeny-based approaches to studying trait evolution, but have
# per-taxon measurements of traits that come from museum specimens with
# uncertain temporal placement. When rand.obs is TRUE, the tips are placed randomly
# within taxon ranges, as if uniformly distributed, and thus multiple trees should be 
# created and analysed.

#' @param node.mins The minimum dates of internal nodes (clades) on a phylogeny can be set
#' using node.mins. This argument takes a vector of the same length as the number of nodes,
#' with dates given in the same order as nodes are ordered in the \code{tree$edge} matrix.
#' Note that in \code{tree$edge}, terminal tips are given the first set of numbers
#' (\code{1:Ntip(tree)}), so the first element of \code{node.mins} is the first internal node
#' (the node numbered \code{Ntip(tree)+1}, which is generally the root for most \code{phylo}
#' objects read by \code{read.tree}). Not all nodes need be given minimum dates; those without
#' minimum dates can be given as NA in \code{node.mins}, but the vector must be the same length
#' as the number of internal nodes in \code{tree}. These are minimum date constraints, such that
#' a node will be 'frozen' by the cal3 algorithm so that constrained nodes will always be
#' \emph{at least as old as this date}, but the final date may be even older depending on the
#' taxon dates used, the parameters input for the cal3 algorithm and any other minimum node dates
#' given (e.g. if a clade is given a very old minimum date, this will (of course) over-ride any
#' minimum dates given for clades that that node is nested within). if the constrained nodes include
#' a polytomy, this polytomy will still be resolved with respect to the cal3 algorithm, but the first
#' divergence will be 'frozen' so that it is at least as old as the minimum age, while any additional
#' divergences will be allowed to occur after this minimum age.

#' @param FAD.only Should the tips represent observation times at the start of
#' the taxon ranges? \code{FAD.only = TRUE}, the resulting output
#' is similar to when terminal ranges are no
#' added on with \code{timePaleoPhy}. If \code{FAD.only = TRUE}
#' and {dateTreatment = "minMax"} or {dateTreatment = "randObs"}, the
#' function will stop and a warning will be produced, as these combinations imply
#' contradictory sets of times of observation.

#' @param adj.obs.wt If the time of observation are before the LAD of a taxon,
#' should the weight of the time of observation be adjusted to account for the
#' known observed history of the taxon which occurs AFTER the time of
#' observation? Should only have an effect if time of observation \emph{IS NOT} the
#' LAD, if times of observation for a potential ancestor are earlier than the
#' first appearance of their potential descendants and if the ancestral weights
#' for taxa are not set to zero (so there can be potential ancestors).

#' @param root.max Maximum time before the first FAD that the root can be
#' pushed back to.

#' @param step.size Step size of increments used in zipper algorithm to assign
#' node ages.

#' @param randres Should polytomies be randomly resolved using \code{multi2di} in ape
#' rather than using the cal3 algorithm to weight the resolution of polytomies 
#' relative to sampling in the fossil record?

#' @param plot If true, plots the input, "basic" time-scaled phylogeny (an
#' intermediary step in the algorithm) and the output
#' cal3 time-scaled phylogeny.

#' @param tolerance Acceptable amount of shift in tip dates from dates listed
#' in \code{timeData}. Shifts outside of the range of \code{tolerance} will
#' cause a warning message to be issued that terminal tips appear to be
#' improperly aligned.

#' @param diagnosticMode If \code{TRUE}, \code{cal3timePaleoPhy} will return to the
#' console and to graphic devices an enormous number of messages, plots and
#' ancilliary information that may be useful or entirely useless to figuring
#' out what is going wrong.

#' @param verboseWarnings if \code{TRUE} (the default), then various warnings and messages
#' regarding best practices will be issued to the console about the analysis. 
#' If \code{FALSE},the function will run as quietly as possible.

#' @param nonstoch.bin If true, dates are not stochastically pulled from
#' uniform distributions. See below for more details.

#' @return The output of these functions is a time-scaled tree or set of
#' time-scaled trees, of either class phylo or multiphylo, depending on the
#' argument ntrees. All trees are output with an element \code{$root.time}. This is
#' the time of the root on the tree and is important for comparing patterns
#' across trees.
#'
#' Additional elements are \code{sampledLogLike} and \code{$sumLogLike} which respectively
#' record a vector containing
#' the 'log-densities' of the various node-ages selected for each tree by the 'zipper'
#' algorithm, and the sum of those log-densities. Although they are very similar to
#' log-likelihood values, they may not be true likelihoods, as node ages are conditional on the other
#' ages selected by other nodes. However, these values may give an indication about the relative
#' optimality of a set of trees output by the cal3 functions.
#'
#' Trees created with \code{bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy} will output with some additional
#' elements, in particular \code{$ranges.used}, a matrix which records the
#' continuous-time ranges generated for time-scaling each tree. (Essentially a
#' pseudo-timeData matrix.)

#' @note Most importantly, please note the stochastic element of the three
#' rate-calibrated time-scaling methods. These do not use traditional
#' optimization methods, but instead draw divergence times from a distribution
#' defined by the probability of intervals of unobserved evolutionary history.
#' This means analyses MUST be done over many cal3 time-scaled trees for
#' analytical rigor! No one tree is correct.
#'
#' Similarly, please account for stratigraphic uncertainty in your analysis.
#' Unless you have exceptionally resolved data, use a wrapper with the cal3
#' function, either the provided \code{bin_cal3TimePaleoPhy} or code a wrapper
#' function of your own that accounts for stratigraphic uncertainty in 
#' your dataset. Remember that the FADs (earliest dates) given to timePaleoPhy
#'  will *always* be used to calibrate node ages!
