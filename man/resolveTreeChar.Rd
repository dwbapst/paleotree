\title{Resolve Polytomies Using Parsimony-Based Reconstruction of a Discrete Character}
\usage{
resolveTreeChar(tree, trait, orderedChar = FALSE, stateBias = NULL,
  iterative = TRUE, cost = NULL, ambiguity = c(NA, "?"),
  dropAmbiguity = FALSE, polySymbol = "&", contrast = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A cladogram of type 'phylo'. Any branch lengths are ignored.}

\item{trait}{A vector of trait values for a discrete character, preferably named with taxon names
identical to the tip labels on the input tree.}

\item{orderedChar}{Is the character of interest given for \code{trait} ordered or not?
If FALSE (the default), then for each polytomy, all child nodes that appear to have the
same state as the ancestor node will remain in the polytomy, and any additional states held by child nodes will
each be grouped into their own unique polytomy that forms from a descendant node of the original polytomy.
If TRUE, then the character will be reconstructed with a cost (step)
matrix of a linear, ordered character, and polytomies will be resolved so that lineages with different
states will be placed into a nested ladder that reflects the ordered character. As with the unordered option,
child nodes with a state equivalent to the ancestral node will remain in the polytomy, while more primitive
or more derived states will be sorted into their own separate ladders composed of paraphyletic groups, ordered
so to move 'away' state-by-state from the ancestral node's inferred character state.}

\item{stateBias}{This argument controls how \code{resolveTreeChar} handles ancestral node reconstructions that have
multiple states competing for the maximum weight of any state (i.e. if states 0 and 1 both have 0.4 of the weight). The
default, where \code{stateBias = NULL} causes uncertainty at nodes among states to be treated as a single 'group' identical
to any states within it. Essentially, this means that for the example polytomy where the ancestor has maximum weight for both 0 and 1, 
any child nodes with 0, 1 or both of these states will be considered to have an identical state for the purpose of grouping nodes
for the purpose of further resolving polytomies. If and only if \code{orderedChar = TRUE}, then additional options of
\code{stateBias = 'primitive'} and \code{stateBias = 'derived'} become available, which instead force uncertain node
assignments to either be the most primitive (i.e. the minimum) or the most derived (i.e. the maximum) among the
maximum-weight states. In particular, \code{stateBias = 'primitive'} should favor gains and bias any analysis of
character transitions against finding reversals.}

\item{iterative}{A logical argument which, if TRUE (the default), causes the function to repeat the polytomy-resolving
functionality across the entire tree until the number of nodes stabilizes. If FALSE, polytomies are only passed a single
time.}

\item{cost}{A matrix of the cost (i.e. number of steps) necessary to
change between states of the input character trait.
If \code{NULL} (the default), the character is assumed to be
unordered with equal cost to change from any state to another.
Cost matrices only impact the "MPR" algorithm; if a cost matrix
is given but \code{type = "ACCTRAN"}, an error is issued.}

\item{ambiguity}{A vector of values which indicate ambiguous
(i.e. missing or unknown) character state codings
in supplied \code{trait} data. Taxa coded ambiguously as treated
as being equally likely to be any state coding.
By default, \code{NA} values and "?" symbols are treated as
ambiguous character codings, in agreement with behavior 
of functions in packages \code{phangorn} and \code{Claddis}. 
This argument is designed to mirror an hidden argument with
an identical name in function \code{phyDat} in package \code{phangorn}.}

\item{dropAmbiguity}{A logical. If \code{TRUE} (which is not
the default), all taxa with ambiguous codings as defined
by argument \code{ambiguity} will be dropped prior to ancestral
nodes being inferred. This may result in too few taxa.}

\item{polySymbol}{A single symbol which separates alternative
states for polymorphic codings; the default symbol is
\code{"&"}, following the output by \code{Claddis}'s
\code{ReadMorphNexus} function, where polymorphic taxa are indicated
by default with a string with state labels separated by an \code{"&"} symbol.
For example, a taxon coded as polymorphic for states
1 or 2, would be indicated by the string \code{"1&2"}.
\code{polySymbol} is used to break up these strings
and automatically construct a fitting \code{contrast} table
for use with this data, including for ambiguous character state codings.}

\item{contrast}{A matrix of type integer with cells of 0
and 1, where each row is labeled with a string value
used for indicating character states in \code{trait},
and each column is labeled with the formal state label to
be used for assign taxa to particular character states.
A value of 1 indicates that the respective coding string for
that row should be interpreted as reflecting the character
state listed for that column. A coding could reflect multiple
states (such as might occur when taxa are polymorphic for
some morphological character), so the sums of rows and
columns can sum to more than 1.  If \code{contrast} is
not \code{NULL} (the default), the arguments will nullify
This argument is designed to mirror an hidden argument with
an identical name in function \code{phyDat} in package {phangorn}.
This structure is based on \code{phangorn}'s use of
\code{contrasts} table used for statistical evaluation of factors.
See the \code{phangorn} vignette "Special features of phangorn" for more details
on its implementation within \code{phangorn} including an example.
See examples below for the construction of an example contrast
matrix for character data with polymorphisms, coded as character
data output by \code{Claddis}'s \code{ReadMorphNexus} function,
where polymorphic taxa are indicated with a string with
state labels separated by an \code{"&"} symbol.}

\value{
Returns the resulting tree, which may be fully resolved, partly more resolved or not more resolved at all
(i.e. have less polytomies) depending on what was possible, as constrained by ambiguities in character
reconstructions. Applying \code{\link{multi2di}} is suggested as a post-step to obtain a fully-resolved
cladogram, if one is desired.
}
\description{
This function resolves a set of given topology with less than fully-binary phylogenetic resolution so that
lineages are shifted and internal nodes added that minimize the number of independent character transitions needed to explain
an observed distribution of discrete character states for the taxa on such a tree, under various maximum-parsimony algorithms of 
ancestral character reconstruction, powered ultimately by function \code{ancestral.pars} in library \code{phangorn}.
This function is mainly designed for use with poorly resolved trees which are being assessed with the function
\code{\link{minCharChange}}.
}
\details{
As shown in the example code below, this function offers a wide variety of options for manipulating the
maximum-parsimony algorithm used (i.e. MPR versus ACCTRAN), the ordering (or not) of character states,
and potential biasing of uncertainty character state reconstructions (when ordered characters are
assessed). This allows for a wide variety of possible resolutions for a given tree with polytomies
and a discrete character. In general, the author expects that use of this function will be optimal
when applied to ordered characters using one of the \code{stateBias} options, perhaps
\code{stateBias = "primitive"} (based on theoretical expectations for slow evolving characters). However,
anecdotal use of this function with various simulation datasets suggests that the results are quite
variable, and so the best option needs to be assessed based on the prior assumptions regarding the
data and the performance of the dataset with the various arguments of this function.
