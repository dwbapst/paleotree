\title{Frequency Ratio Method for Estimating Sampling Probability}
\usage{
freqRat(timeData, calcExtinction = FALSE, plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeData}{A 2 column matrix with the first and last occurrences of taxa
given in relative time intervals. If a list of length two is given for
timeData, such as would be expected if the output of binTimeData was
directly input, the second element is used.}

\item{calcExtinction}{If TRUE, the per-interval, per-lineage extinction rate 
is estimated as the negative slope of the log frequencies, ignoring single
hits (as described in Foote and Raup, 1996.)}

\item{plot}{If true, the histogram of observed taxon ranges is plotted, with
frequencies on a linear scale}
}
\value{
This function returns the per-interval sampling probability as the
"freqRat", and estimates
}
\description{
Estimate per-interval sampling probability in the fossil record from a set
of discrete-interval taxon ranges using the frequency-ratio method described
by Foote and Raup (1996). Can also calculate extinction rate per interval from
the same data distribution.
}
\details{
This function uses the frequency ratio ("freqRat") method of Foote and Raup
(1996) to estimate the per-interval sampling rate for a set of taxa. This
method assumes that intervals are of fairly similar length and that
taxonomic extinction and sampling works similar to homogenous Poisson
processes. These analyses are ideally applied to data from single
stratigraphic section but potentially are applicable to regional or global
datasets, although the behavior of those datasets is less well understood.

The frequency ratio is a simple relationship between the number of taxa
observed only in a single time interval (also known as singletons), the
number of taxa observed only in two time intervals and the number of taxa
observed in three time intervals. These respective frequencies, respectively
f1, f2 and f3 can then be related to the per-interval sampling probability
with the following expression.

\eqn{Sampling.Probability = (f2^2)/(f1*f3)}

This frequency ratio is generally referred to as the 'freqRat' in
paleobiological literature.

It is relatively easy to visually test if range data fits expectation that
true taxon durations are exponentially distributed by plotting the
frequencies of the observed ranges on a log scale: data beyond the
'singletons' category should have a linear slope, implying that durations
were originally exponentially distributed. (Note, a linear scale is used for
the plotting diagram made by this function when 'plot' is TRUE, so that plot
cannot be used for this purpose.)

The accuracy of this method tends to be poor at small interval length and
even relatively large sample sizes. A portion at the bottom of the examples
in the help file examine this issue in greater detail with simulations. This
package author recommends using the ML method developed in Foote (1997)
instead, which is usable via the function \code{\link{make_durationFreqDisc}}.

As extant taxa should not be included in a freqRat calculation, any taxa
listed as being in a bin with start time 0 and end time 0 (and thus being
extant without question) are dropped before the model fitting it performed.

#Simulate some fossil ranges with simFossilRecord
set.seed(444)
record <- simFossilRecord(p = 0.1, q = 0.1, nruns = 1,
	nTotalTaxa = c(30,40), nExtant = 0)
taxa <- fossilRecord2fossilTaxa(record)
#simulate a fossil record with imperfect sampling with sampleRanges
rangesCont <- sampleRanges(taxa,r = 0.1)
#Now let's use binTimeData to bin in intervals of 5 time units
rangesDisc <- binTimeData(rangesCont,int.length = 5)

#now, get an estimate of the sampling rate (we set it to 0.5 above)
#for discrete data we can estimate the sampling probability per interval (R)
    #i.e. this is not the same thing as the instantaneous sampling rate (r)
#can use sRate2sProb to see what we would expect
sRate2sProb(r = 0.1,int.length = 5)
#expect R = ~0.39

#now we can apply freqRat to get sampling probability
SampProb <- freqRat(rangesDisc,plot = TRUE)
SampProb

#est. R = ~0.25 
#Not wildly accurate, is it?

#can also calculate extinction rate per interval of time
freqRat(rangesDisc,calcExtinction = TRUE)

#est. ext rate = ~0.44 per interval
#5 time-unit intervals, so ~0.44 / 5 = ~0.08 per time-unite
#That's pretty close to the generating value of 0.01, used in sampleRanges
