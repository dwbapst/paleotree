#' Partitions the branch lengths of a tree into several classes based on their placement.
#'
#' @details This function will partition the internode (node to node, including internal node to terminal tip) branch lengths of a tree into 
#' four separate classes: all (all the internode branches of a tree), int (internal branches
#' which run from one internode to another), live (terminal branches which run from an internal node to 
#' a terminal tip representing an extinction event before the present) and dead (terminal branches 
#' which run from an internal node to a terminal tip at the modern day, reflecting a still-living taxon).
#'
#' The depths of the internal 'mother' node (i.e. time of origin, before the modern day 
#' of each branch length are included as the /code{names} of the branch length vectors.
#'
#' This function is mainly of use for modeling internode branch lengths in a phylogeny including fossil taxa.

#' @param tree A time-scaled phylogeny to be analyzed, as an object of class phylo, ideally with a $root.time element as is
#' typical for paleotree output phylogenies. If $root.time is not present, the most recent tips will be interpreted as 
#' being at the modern day (i.e. 0 time-units before present).

#' @param whichExtant A logical vector with length equal to number of tips in the tree. TRUE indicates a taxon that is extant
#' at the modern day, while FALSE equates to extinction. If present, this vector is used
#' for determining which taxa are extant, and which are extinct.

#' @param tol Tolerance used to distinguish extant taxa, if whichExtant is not provided, to avoid issues with number rounding. Taxa within tol of 
#' the modern day will be considered extant.

#' @return The output is a list consisting of four vectors, with the /code{names} of the vectors being their
#' corresponding time of origin. See details.
