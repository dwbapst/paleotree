\title{Models of Sampling and Extinction for Taxonomic Duration Datasets}
\usage{
make_durationFreqCont(timeData, groups = NULL, drop.extant = TRUE,
  threshold = 0.01, tol = 1e-04)

make_durationFreqDisc(timeList, groups = NULL, drop.extant = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{timeData}{Two-column matrix of per-taxon first and last occurrence
given in continuous time, relative to the modern (i.e. older dates are also
the 'larger' dates). Unsampled taxa (e.g. from a simulation of sampling 
in the fossil record, listed as NAs the supplied matrix) are automatically
dropped from the matrix and from groups simultaneously.}

\item{groups}{Either NULL (the default) or matrix with the number of rows equal
to the number of taxa and the number of columns equal to the number of 'systems'
of categories for taxa. Taxonomic membership in different groups is indicated
by numeric values. For example, a dataset could have a 'groups' matrix composed
of a column representing thin and thick shelled taxa, coded 1 and 2 respectively,
while the second column indicates whether taxa live in coastal,
outer continental shelf, or deep
marine settings, coded 1-3 respectively. Different combinations of groups will
be treated as having independent sampling and extinction parameters in the
default analysis, for example, thinly-shelled deep marine species will have
separate parameters from thinly-shelled coastal species. Grouping systems could
also represent temporal heterogeneity, for example, categorizing Paleozoic versus
Mesozoic taxa. If groups are NULL (the default), all taxa are assumed to be of
the same group with the same parameters. Unsampled taxa (e.g. from a simulation
of sampling in the fossil record, listed as NAs in timeData or timeList)
are automatically dropped from groupings and the time dataset (either timeData
or timeList) and from groups simultaneously.}

\item{drop.extant}{Drops all extant taxa from a dataset, w}

\item{threshold}{The smallest allowable duration (i.e. the measured difference in
the first and last occurrence dates for a given taxon). Durations below this size 
will be treated as "one-hit" sampling events.}

\item{tol}{Tolerance level for determining whether a taxon from a continuous-time
analysis is extant or not. Taxa which occur at a date less than tol are treated as
occurring at the modern day (i.e. being functionally identical as occurring at 0 time).}

\item{timeList}{A 2 column matrix with the first and last occurrences of taxa
given in relative time intervals (i.e. ordered from first to last). If a list
of length two is given for timeData, such as would be expected if the output 
of binTimeData was directly input, the second element is used. See details.
Unsampled taxa (e.g. from a simulation of sampling in the fossil record,
listed as NAs in the second matrix) are automatically dropped from the
timeList and from groups simultaneously. Living taxa observed in the modern day
are expected to be listed as last observed in a special interval (0,0), i.e.
begins and ends at 0 time. This interval is always automatically removed prior
to the calculation intermediary data for fitting likelihood functions.}
}
\value{
A function of class "paleotreeFunc", which takes a vector equal to the number
of parameters and returns the *negative* log likelihood (for use with optim and
similar optimizing functions, which attempt to minimize support values). See the
functions listed at \code{\link{modelMethods}} for manipulating and examining
such functions and \code{\link{constrainParPaleo}} for constraining parameters.

Parameters in the output functions are named 'q' for the instantaneous per-capita
extinction rate, 'r' for the instantaneous per-capita sampling rate and 'R' for
the per-interval taxonomic sampling probability. Groupings follow the parameter
names, separated by periods; by default, the parameters will be placed in at
least group 1 (of a grouping with a single group), such that make_durationFreqCont
by default creates a function with parameters named 'q.1' and 'r.1', while
make_durationFreqDisc creates a function with parameters named 'q.1' and 'R.1'.

Note that the 'q' parameters estimated by \code{make_durationFreqDisc} is scaled to 
per lineage intervals and not to per lineage time-units. If intervals are the same length, this
can be easily corrected by multiplying 1 by the interval length. It is unclear
how to treat uneven intervals and I urge workers to consider multiple strategies.

For translating these sampling probabilities and sampling rates, see
\code{\link{SamplingConv}}.

\description{
These functions construct likelihood models of the observed frequency
of taxon durations, given either in discrete (\code{make_durationFreqDisc}) 
or continuous time (\code{make_durationFreqCont}). These models can then be
constrained using functions available in this package and/or analyzed 
with commonly used optimizing functions.
}
\details{
These functions effectively replace two older functions in paleotree, now removed,
\code{getSampRateCont} and \code{getSampProbDisc}. The
functions here do not offer the floating time interval options of
their older siblings, but do allow for greater flexibility in defining
constrains on parameter values. Differences in time intervals, or any
other conceivable discrete differences in parameters, can be modeled
using the generic \code{groups} argument in these functions.

These functions use likelihood functions presented by Foote (1997).
These analyses are ideally applied to data from single stratigraphic section
but potentially are applicable to regional or global datasets, although the
behavior of those datasets is less well understood.

As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero and older dates are 'larger'. On
the contrary, relative time is in intervals with non-zero integers that
increase sequentially beginning with 1, from earliest to oldest.

For \code{make_durationFreqDisc}, the intervals in timeList should be
non-overlapping sequential intervals of roughly equal length. These
should be in relative time as described above, so the earliest interval
should be 1 and the numbering should increase as the intervals go up with
age. If both previous statements are true, then differences in interval
numbers will represent the same rough difference in the absolute timing
of those intervals. For example, a dataset where all taxa are listed from
a set of sequential intervals of similar length, such as North American
Mammal assemblage zones, microfossil faunal zones or graptolite biozones
can be given as long as they are correctly numbered in sequential order
in the input. As a counter example, a dataset which includes taxa resolved
only to intervals as wide as the whole Jurassic and taxa resolved to
biozones within the Jurassic should not be included in the same input.
Drop taxa from less poorly resolved intervals from such datasets if you
want to apply this function, as long as this retains a large enough sample
of taxa listed from the sequential set of intervals. 

Please check that the optimizer function you select actually converges. The
likelihood surface can be very flat in some cases, particularly for small
datasets (<100 taxa). If the optimizer does not converge, consider
increasing iterations or changing the starting values.

#new ways of doing it

#as opposed to getSampRateCont, we can do:
likFun <- make_durationFreqCont(rangesCont)

optim(parInit(likFun),likFun,lower = parLower(likFun),upper = parUpper(likFun),
     method = "L-BFGS-B",control = list(maxit = 1000000))

#these give the same answers (as we'd expect them to!)

#with newer functions we can constrain our functions easily
    # what if we knew the extinction rate = 0.1 a priori?
likFun <- make_durationFreqCont(rangesCont)
likFun <- constrainParPaleo(likFun,q.1~0.1)
optim(parInit(likFun),likFun,lower = parLower(likFun),upper = parUpper(likFun),

#actually decreases our sampling rate estimate
   # gets further away from true generating value, r = 0.5 (geesh!)
   # but this *is* a small dataset...
