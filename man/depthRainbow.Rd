\title{Paint Tree Branch Depth by Color}
\usage{
depthRainbow(tree)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogeny, as an object of class \code{phylo}.}
}
\value{
No value returned, just plots a colorful phylogeny.
}
\description{
Paints the edges of a phylogeny with colors relative to their depth.
}
\details{
The only purpose of this function is to make an aesthetically-pleasing
graphic of one's tree, where branches are color-coded with a rainbow
palette, relative to their depth. Depth is defined relative to the number of
branching nodes between the basal node of a branch and the root, not the
absolute distance (i.e. branch length) to the root or the distance from the
tips.

\examples{

set.seed(444)
tree <- rtree(500)
