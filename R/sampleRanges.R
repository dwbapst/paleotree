#' Sampling Taxon Ranges
#' 
#' A function for simulating the effect of incomplete sampling of the fossil
#' record.
#' 
#' @details 
#' This function implements a range of sampling models in continuous time. Be
#' default, sampling is simulated under the simplest model, where sampling
#' occurs as a Poisson process under a instantaneous sampling rate (r) which is
#' homogeneous through time and across lineages (Foote, 1997). Under this model,
#' the waiting times to sampling events are exponentially distributed, with an
#' average waiting time of 1/r. This useful property allows sampling to be
#' rapidly simulated for many taxa under this simple model in \code{sampleRanges}, by
#' repeatedly drawing waiting times between sampling events from an exponential
#' distribution. This is the model that is run when 
#' \code{alpha}, \code{beta} and \code{rTimeRatio}.
#' 
#' In addition to this simple model, sampleRanges also can consider a range of
#' additional models, including the \emph{hatP} and \emph{incP} options of Liow et al.
#' (2010). To describe the behavior of these models, users alter the default
#' values for \code{alpha}, \code{beta} and \code{rTimeRatio}.
#' These parameters, and \code{r}, can either
#' be a single value which describes the behavior of the entire dataset or as a
#' vector, of same length as the number of taxa, which describes the per-taxon
#' value.  When any \code{rTimeRatio}, alpha or beta value is not equal to one, then
#' the sampling rate will vary across the duration of a taxon's temporal range.
#' In general, setting alpha and beta equal to a value above 2 produce "hat" or
#' bell-shaped curves where sampling rates peak at the midpoint of taxon
#' ranges, while setting them unequal will produce asymmetric bell curves
#' according to the beta function (Liow et al., 2010; Liow et al. set
#' \code{alpha = 4} and \code{beta = 4}). \code{rTimeRatio} is the
#' ratio of the sampling rate of the
#' latest/most recent time divided by the earliest/oldest time.
#' 
#' The input r values will be interpreted differently based on whether one r
#' value or per-taxon values were used. If one value was input, then it is
#' assumed that r represent the grand mean r for the entire dataset for purposes
#' of time-varying r, such that if \code{rTimeRatio} is not equal to 1, taxa near the
#' end and start of the dataset will have very different per-taxon mean
#' sampling rate. If per-taxon values of r were input, then each r is consider
#' the per-taxon mean sampling rate. These will not be changed, but any
#' within-lineage variation is distributed so that the mean is still the input
#' per-taxon value. This also changes the interpretation of \code{rTimeRatio}, such
#' that when a single r value and \code{rTimeRatio} is given, it is assumed the ratio
#' describes the change in sampling rates from the start of the dataset to the
#' end, while if multiple values are given for either r or \code{rTimeRatio} will
#' instead see the value as describing the ratio at the first and last times of
#' each taxon. For the pure hat model, this interpretation of 'r' as a grand mean
#' sampling means that taxa will have a sampling rate of 2*r at the mid-peak of their
#' range, which will have considerable implications for taxonomic incompleteness.
#' 
#' The particular distinctions about these parameter values are important: all
#' models simulated in sampleRanges are structured to be effectively nested
#' inside a most general model with parameters \code{r},
#' \code{alpha}, \code{beta} and \code{rTimeRatio}.
#' 
#' Note that the modeling of sampling in this function is independent and
#' secondary of the actual simulation of the ranges, which are (generally)
#' produced by the models of simFossilRecord with argument \code{r}
#' (sampling rate) not set. Thus, 'hat-shaped range
#' distributions' are only contained within single morphotaxa; they do not
#' cross multiple morphotaxa in the case of anagenesis. Cryptic taxa each have
#' their own hat and do not share a single hat; by default the ranges of
#' cryptic taxa are merged to produce the range of a single observed
#' morphotaxon.
#' 
#' 'Hats' are constrained to start and end with a taxon's range, representing
#' the rise and fall of taxa in terms of abundance and geographic range (Liow
#' et al., 2010). However, for still-living taxa at the modern day, it is
#' unknown how much longer they may be alive (for memoryless Poisson models,
#' there is no age-dependent extinction). The treatment of these taxa with
#' regards to their 'hat' (i. e. the beta distribution) is controlled by randLivehat:
#' when \code{ranLiveHat = FALSE}, the beta distribution is fit so that the last appearance of
#' still-alive taxa at the modern day is treated as a last appearance for
#' calculating the hat. When \code{TRUE},
#' the default option, the still-alive taxa are considered to have gotten some
#' distance between 0 and 1 through the beta distribution, as of the modern
#' day. This point of progression is stochastically selected for each taxon by
#' pulling a number from a uniform distribution, and used for calculating the hat.
#' 
#' Because sampling rate varies over morphotaxon ranges under any of these more
#' complex models, sampling events cannot be quickly simulated as waiting times
#' pulled from an exponential distribution. Instead, the taxon durations are
#' discretized into a large number of small time intervals of length minInt
#' (see above; minInt should be small enough that only one sampling event could
#' feasibly happen per interval). The probability of an event occurring within
#' each interval is calculated and used to stochastically simulate sampling
#' events. For each interval, a number between 0 and 1 is randomly pulled from
#' a uniform distribution and to the per-interval sampling probability to test
#' if a sampling event occurred (if the random number is less than the
#' probability, a sampling event is recorded). In general, this method is
#' slower but otherwise comparable to the quicker waiting times method. See the
#' examples below for a small test of this.
#' 
#' As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
#' decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.
#' 
#' If \code{min.taxa} is set to zero, the simulation may produce output in which no
#' taxa were ever sampled.
#' 
#' If \code{modern.samp.prob} is set to 1.0 (the default), then living taxa will
#' always be sampled at least at the present day (if there are any living
#' taxa). If the probability is less than 1, they will be sampled with that
#' probability at the modern day.
#' 
#' By default, this function will merge sampling events from morphologically
#' cryptic taxa, listing them as occurrences for the earliest member of that
#' group. To change this behavior, set \code{merge.cryptic = FALSE}.
#' 
#' Conditioning on sampling some minimum number of taxa may create strange
#' simulation results for some analyses, such as simulation analyses of
#' birth-death processes. Set min.taxa = 0 to remove this conditioning.
#' 


#' @param taxad A two-column matrix of per-taxon ranges. The five-column matrix
#' output of \code{simFossilRecord}, post transformation with \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa}
#' can also be supplied, which will be common in simulation usages.

#' @param r Instantaneous average sampling rate per lineage time units; given
#' as a vector of length one or length equal to the number of taxa.

#' @param alpha Alpha parameter of beta distribution; given as a vector of
#' length one or length equal to the number of taxa.

#' @param beta Beta parameter of beta distribution; given as a vector of length
#' one or length equal to the number of taxa.

#' @param rTimeRatio Ratio of most recent sampling rate over earliest sampling
#' rate; given as a vector of length one or length equal to the number of taxa.

#' @param modern.samp.prob Probability of sampling living taxa at the present
#' day (time = 0), see below.

#' @param min.taxa Minimum number of taxa sampled. The default is 2.

#' @param ranges.only If \code{TRUE}, gives taxon first and last occurrences only. If
#' FALSE, gives the time of all sampling events as a list.

#' @param minInt Minimum interval size used for simulating complex models

#' @param merge.cryptic If \code{TRUE}, sampling events for cryptic species will be
#' merged into one taxon.

#' @param randLiveHat If \code{TRUE}, taxa still alive at modern day have the
#' end-point of their 'hat' chosen from a uniform distribution.

#' @param alt.method If \code{TRUE}, use the alternative method of discretizing time
#' even if a simple model of sampling is being simulated.

#' @param plot If \code{TRUE}, plots the sampling models for each taxon against time.

#' @return If ranges.only is \code{TRUE}, then the output is a two-column per-taxon
#' matrix of first and last appearances in absolute time. NAs mean the taxon
#' was never sampled in the simulation.
#' 
#' If \code{ranges.only = FALSE} (the default), the output is a list, where each
#' element is a vector of sampling events the timing of sampling events, each
#' corresponding to a different taxon in the input. Elements that are \code{NA} are
#' unsampled taxa.
