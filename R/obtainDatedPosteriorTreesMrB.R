#' Get the Sample of Posterior Trees from a Dated Phylogenetic Analysis with MrBayes (Or a Summary Tree, such as the MCCT)
#' 
#' MrBayes is not great for getting samples of dated posterior phylogenies, or for obtaining certain summary trees from
#' the posterior (specifically the MCCT and MAP, which are specific trees in the posterior). This is because the tree
#' samples as returned are scaled relative to rate parameters in a separate file. This function attempts to automate
#' the handling of multiple files (both .t tree files and .p parameter files), as well as multiple files
#' associated with separate runs, to obtain samples of posterior trees, or summary trees such as the MCCT or MAP.

#' @details
#' This function is most useful for dealing with dating analyses in MrBayes, particularly when tip-dating
#' a tree with fossil taxa, as the half-compatibility and all-compatibility summary trees offered by the
#' 'sumt' command in MrBayes can have issues properly portraying summary trees from such datasets.

#' @param runFile A filename in the current directory, or a path to a file that is either a .p 
#' or .t file from a MrBayes analysis. This filename and path will be used for finding additional 
#' .t and .p files, via the \code{nRuns} settings and assuming that files are in the
#' same directory \emph{and} these files are named under
#' typical MrBayes file naming conventions. (In other words, if you have renamed your .p or .t files,
#' this function probably won't be able to find them.)

#' @param nRuns The number of runs in your analysis. This variable is used for figuring out what 
#' filenames will be searched for: specify less runs than reality and some runs won't be included.
#' Specify too many, and this function will throw an error when it cannot find files it expects
#' but do not exist. The default for this argument (two runs) is based on the default number of runs in MrBayes.

#' @param burnin The fraction of trees sampled in the posterior discarded  and not returned
#' by this function directly, nor included in calculation of summary trees. Must be a numeric
#' value greater than 0 and less than 1.

#' @param getFixedTimes If \code{TRUE}, this function will also look for, scan, and parse an
#' associated NEXUS file. Ignoring any commented lines (ie. anything between "[   ]" ), commands
#' for fixing taxa will be identified, parsed and returned to the user, either as a message
#' pinted to the R console if output is read to a file, or as a attribute named 'fixed ages'
#' if output as an R object (formatted as a two-column table of OTU names and their respective fixed ages).
#' Please note: this code contains a while() loop in it for removing nested series of
#' square brackets (i.e. treated as comments in NEXUS files) then files with
#' ridicuously nested series of brackets may cause this code to take a while
#' to complete, or may even cause it to hang.

#' @param originalNexusFile Filename (and possibly path too) to the original NEXUS file for this analysis.
#' Only tried if \code{getFixedTimes = TRUE}. If \code{NULL} (the default), then this function will
#' instead try to find a NEXUS file with the same name as implied by the filename used in other inputs. If
#' this file cannot be found, the function will fail. 

#' @param labelPostProb Logical. If \code{TRUE}, then nodes of the
#' output tree will be labeled with their respective posterior 
#' probabilities, as calculated based on the frequency of a clade
#' occurring across the post-burnin posterior tree sample. If \code{FALSE},
#' this is skipped.
	
#' @param outputTrees Determines the output trees produced; for format of output, see section
#' on returned Value below. Must be of length one, and either \code{"all"},
#' which means all trees from the post-burnin posterior will
#' returned, a number greater than zero, which will be the number of trees
#' randomly sampled from across the post-burning posterior and returned,
#' or \code{"MCCT"} and \code{"MAP"}, which stand for 'maximum clade compatibility tree'
#' and 'maximum a posteri tree' respectively. The MAP is the single tree from the post-burnin
#' posterior with the highest marginal likelihood. The MCCT is the single tree from the post-burnin
#' posterior which contains clades with the highest product of posterior probabilities for its
#' component clades. Thus, the MAP is the best overall tree, while the MCCT may be the best
#' tree for summarizing topological support.

#' @param file Filename (possibly with path) as a character string
#' leading to a file which will be overwritten with the output trees (or summary tree),
#' as a NEXUS file. If \code{NULL} (the default), the output will
#' instead be directly returned by this function.

#' @return
#' Depending on argument \code{file}, this output is either
#' returned directly, or instead written out in NEXUS format via
#' ape's \code{write.NEXUS} function to an external file. The output
#' will consist either of multiple trees sampled from the post-burnin posterior,
#' or will consist of a single phylogeny (a summary tree, either the MCCT or the MAP).
#' 
#' Users are warned that the resulting dated trees will not have \code{$root.time} elements
#' for comparison against an absolute time-scale. Most functions for phylogenetics in R (and
#' elsewhere) will instead presume that the latest tip will be at time 0 (the modern), which
#' may be wrong if you are using \code{paleotree} for \emph{paleontological} datasets.
