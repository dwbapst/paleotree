#' Plotting Occurrence Data Across Taxa
#' 
#' \code{plotOccData} takes occurrence data which has been sorted into a by-taxon list,
#' such as that output by \code{taxonSortPBDBocc} or may be output by simulations using
#' \code{sampleRanges} and produces a plot showing the age uncertainty associated with
#' individual occurrences, with occurrences of the same taxon grouped by color.

#' @details
#' This function was originally conceived of in the following blog post: 
#' \href{http://nemagraptus.blogspot.com/2015/02/how-do-we-treat-fossil-age-data-dates.html}{Link}
#' 

#' @param occList A list where every element is a table of occurrence data for a different taxon,
#' such as that returned by \code{\link{taxonSortPBDBocc}}. The occurrence data can be either a 
#' two-column matrix composed of the lower and upper age bounds on each taxon occurrence, or has
#' two named variables which match any of the field names given by the PBDB API under either
#' the 'pbdb' vocab or 'com' (compact) vocab for early and late age bounds.

#' @param groupLabel A character vector with a single string giving the name for
#' the occurrence dataset used, such as the taxonomic name of the group examined.
#' If not given (the default) a generic plot title is appended.

#' @param occColors A vector of numbers or characters indicating colors on a color
#' palette for use with the basic \code{plot} function. 
#' Must be the same length as \code{occList}. If empty, as with the
#' default, the colors used are sampled randomly from the \code{rainbow} function.

#' @param lineWidth A numeric value giving the length to be used for the width of lines
#' plotted in \code{plotOccData}. If not given (the default), this is calculated using
#' an algorithm that selects an optimal line width for plotting.

#' @param xlims A two element vector controlling the width of the horizontal time-scale
#' the occurrence bars are plotted against. By default, this is not given and calculated
#' internally.

#' @return
#' This function will invisibly return a list, with each per-taxon element containing the
#' two-column matrix of age bounds for occurrences.

#' @seealso
#' Occurrence data as commonly used with \code{paleotree} functions can
#' be obtained with \code{link{getPBDBocc}}, and sorted into taxa by 
#' \code{\link{taxonSortPBDBocc}}, and further explored with this function and
#' \code{\link{occData2timeList}}. Also, see the example graptolite dataset
#' at \code{\link{graptPBDB}}
