\title{Calculating Diversity Curves Across Multiple Datasets}
\usage{
multiDiv(data, int.length = 1, plot = TRUE, split.int = TRUE,
  drop.ZLB = TRUE, drop.cryptic = FALSE, extant.adjust = 0.01,
  plotLogRich = FALSE, yAxisLims = NULL, timelims = NULL,
  int.times = NULL, plotMultCurves = FALSE, multRainbow = TRUE,
  divPalette = NULL, divLineType = 1, main = NULL)

plotMultiDiv(results, plotLogRich = FALSE, timelims = NULL,
  yAxisLims = NULL, plotMultCurves = FALSE, multRainbow = TRUE,
  divPalette = NULL, divLineType = 1, main = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A list where each element is a dataset, formatted to be input in
one of the diversity curve functions listed in \code{\link{DiversityCurves}}.}

\item{int.length}{The length of intervals used to make the diversity curve.
Ignored if int.times is given.}

\item{plot}{If \code{TRUE}, the median diversity curve is plotted.}

\item{split.int}{For discrete time data, should calculated/input intervals
be split at discrete time interval boundaries? If FALSE, can create apparent
artifacts in calculating the diversity curve. See below.}

\item{drop.ZLB}{If true, zero-length terminal branches are dropped from the
input tree for phylogenetic datasets, before calculating standing diversity.}

\item{drop.cryptic}{If TRUE, cryptic taxa are merged to form one taxon for
estimating taxon curves. Only works for objects from \code{simFossilRecord}
via \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa}.}

\item{extant.adjust}{Amount of time to be added to extend start time for
(0,0) bins for extant taxa, so that the that 'time interval' does not appear 
to have an infinitely small width.}

\item{plotLogRich}{If TRUE, taxic diversity is plotted on log scale.}

\item{yAxisLims}{Limits for the y (i.e. richness) axis on the plotted diversity curves. Only
affects plotting. Given as either NULL (the default) or as a vector of
length two as for \code{xlim} in the basic R function \code{plot}. Time axes 
will be plotted \emph{exactly} to these values. The minimum value must be more than 1 if
\code{plotLogRich = TRUE}.}

\item{timelims}{Limits for the x (time) axis for diversity curve plots. Only
affects plotting. Given as either NULL (the default) or as a vector of
length two as for \code{xlim} in the basic R function \code{plot}. Time axes 
will be plotted \emph{exactly} to these values.}

\item{int.times}{An optional two-column matrix of the interval start and end
times for calculating the diversity curve. If NULL, calculated internally.
If given, the argument split.int and int.length are ignored.}

\item{plotMultCurves}{If \code{TRUE}, each individual diversity curve is plotted
rather than the median diversity curve and 95 percent quantiles. FALSE by
default.}

\item{multRainbow}{If \code{TRUE} and plotMultCurves are both \code{TRUE}, each line is
plotted as a different, randomized color using the function 'rainbow'. If
FALSE, each line is plotted as a black line. This argument is ignored if
divPalette is supplied.}

\item{divPalette}{Can be used so users can pass a vector of chosen color
identifiers for each diversity curve in 'data' which will take precedence
over multRainbow. Must be the same length as the number of diversity curves
supplied.}

\item{divLineType}{Used to determine line type (\code{lty}) of the
diversity curves plotted when \code{plotMultCurves  = } \code{TRUE}. Default
is \code{lty = 1} for all curves. Must be either length of 1 or 
exact length as number of diversity curves.}

\item{main}{The main label for the figure.}

\item{results}{The output of a previous run of multiDiv for replotting.}
}
\value{
A list composed of three elements will be invisibly returned:
\item{int.times}{A two column matrix giving interval start and end times}
\item{div}{A matrix of measured diversities in particular intervals by rows,
with each column representing a different dataset included in the input}
\item{median.curve}{A three column matrix, where the first column is the
calculated median curve and the second and third columns are the 95 percent
quantile upper and lower bounds}
}
\description{
Calculates multiple diversity curves from a list of datasets of taxic ranges
and/or phylogenetic trees, for the same intervals, for all the individual
datasets. A median curve with 95 percent quantile bounds is also calculated
and plotted for each interval.
}
\details{
This function is essentially a wrapper for the individual diversity curve
functions included in paleotree. multiDiv will intuitively decide whether
input datasets are continuous-time taxic ranges, discrete-time (binned
interval) taxic ranges or phylogenetic trees, as long as they are formatted
as required by the respective diversity curve functions. A list that
contains a mix of data types is entirely acceptable. A list of matrices
output from \code{fossilRecord2fossilTaxa}, via simulation with \code{simFossilRecord}
is allowable, and treated as input for \code{taxicDivCont}.
Data of an unknown type gives back an error.

The argument split.int splits intervals, if and only if discrete interval
time data is included among the datasets. See the help file for taxicDivDisc
to see an explanation of why \code{split.int = TRUE} by default is probably a good
thing.

As with many functions in the paleotree library, absolute time is always
decreasing, i.e. the present day is zero.

The 'averaged' curve is actually the median rather than the mean as
diversity counts are often highly skewed (in this author's experience).

The shaded certainty region around the median curve is the two-tailed 95
percent lower and upper quantiles, calculated from the observed data. It is
not a true probabilisitic confidence interval, as it has no relationship to
the standard error.
